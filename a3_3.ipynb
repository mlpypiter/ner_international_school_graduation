      "[In the very same inn with us!, Would she recollect him?, Anne, Anne,\" cried Charles, \"What is to be done next?, A bowing acquaintance., More air than one often sees in Bath., \"I am sorry to say that I am very far from well; and Jemima has just told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore-throat very much about., \"You will not find anything very agreeable in him, I assure you, ma'am., I do not know when or where, but a great while before he died, poor fellow!, , she gave it up, It was the choicest gift of Heaven; and Anne viewed her friend as one of those instances in which, by a merciful appointment, it seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want., \"I knew pretty well what she was before that day;\" said he, smiling., Are you going near Camden Place?, The sounds were retreating, and Anne distinguished no more., He was not only to quit his home, but to see it in the hands of others; a trial of fortitude, which stronger heads than Sir Walter's have found too much., She sat an hour with me on Monday evening, and gave me the whole history.\", Lady Russell quite bores one with her new publications., He looked at her with a smile, and a little motion of the head, which expressed, \"Come to me, I have something to say;\" and the unaffected, easy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance than he really was, strongly enforced the invitation., In each letter he had spoken well of his captain; but yet, so little were they in the habit of attending to such matters, so unobservant and incurious, He has not been forced upon any exertion., Chapter 23, I know what is due to my tenant., Mrs Clay had freckles, and a projecting tooth, and a clumsy wrist, which he was continually making severe remarks upon, in her absence; but she was young, and certainly altogether well-looking, and possessed, in an acute mind and assiduous pleasing manners, infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal might have been., That's what he did, and nobody else could have saved poor James., It was soon drawn, perforce another way., She could not distinguish, but she must guess the subject; and on Captain Wentworth's making a distant bow, she comprehended that her father had judged so well as to give him that simple acknowledgement of acquaintance, and she was just in time by a side glance to see a slight curtsey from Elizabeth herself., On the contrary, when he saw more of Captain Wentworth, saw him repeatedly by daylight, and eyed him well, he was very much struck by his personal claims, and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her superiority of rank; and all this, assisted by his well-sounding name, enabled Sir Walter at last to prepare his pen, with a very good grace, for the insertion of the marriage in the volume of honour., I hate to hear of women on board, or to see them on board; and no ship under my command shall ever convey a family of ladies anywhere, if I can help it., He will be here in a moment, I am sure., It is early.\", Captain Wentworth believed it impossible for man to be more attached to woman than, And before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation, Charles, Mary, and Henrietta all came in., It was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and inhumanity; and Anne felt, at some moments, that no flagrant open crime could have been worse., I believe the reverse., What Miss Anne says, is very true,\" was Mr Shepherd's rejoinder, and, He must love somebody., You never mentioned it before., This was against her; but on the other hand, he spent so much of his time at Uppercross, that in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him behind, than as going towards him; and, upon the whole, she believed she must, on this interesting question, be the gainer, almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society, in leaving poor Mary for Lady Russell., The comfort, the freedom, the gaiety of the room was over, hushed into cold composure, determined silence, or insipid talk, to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister., There was consciousness of some sort or other., such readiness to apologize for the past, such solicitude to be received as a relation again, that their former good understanding was completely re-established., It was a commission to me!, Another circumstance very essential for her to know, was how long he meant to be in Bath, Are not you astonished?, The tone, the look, with which \"Thank God!\" was uttered by Captain Wentworth, Anne was sure could never be forgotten by her; nor the sight of him afterwards, as he sat near a table, leaning over it with folded arms and face concealed, as if overpowered by the various feelings of his soul, and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them., I wish his friends would propose it to him., His tone, his expressions, his choice of subject, his knowing where to stop; it was all the operation of a sensible, discerning mind., \"I was not at all aware of this., A chaise was sent for from Crewkherne, and Charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery-maid of the family, one who having brought up all the children, and seen the very last, the lingering and long-petted Master Harry, sent to school after his brothers, was now living in her deserted nursery to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises, There was never any burst of feeling, any warmth of indignation or delight, at the evil or good of others., Have you not seen this?, Her sensations on the discovery made her perfectly speechless., poor Benwick had been to Fanny Harville, or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful change., if you are determined to walk; though I think it would be more prudent to let me get you a chair., All the privilege I claim for my own sex (it is not a very enviable one; you need not covet it), is that of loving longest, when existence or when hope is gone., Musgrove, take care of the others., She felt its application to herself, felt it in a nervous thrill all over her; and at the same moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table, Captain Wentworth's pen ceased to move, his head was raised, pausing, listening, and he turned round the next instant to give a look, one quick, conscious look at her., Like other great men under reverses,\" he added, with a smile., They were too much like joy, senseless joy!, As soon as they were fairly ascending Belmont, he began-- \"Well, now you shall hear something that will surprise you., You will soon be able to judge of the general credit due, by listening to some particulars which you can yourself immediately contradict or confirm., He described one Miss Elliot, and I thought very affectionately of the other.\", You must allow for an injured, angry woman., Shocked as Captain Harville was, he brought senses and nerves that could be instantly useful; and a look between him and his wife decided what was to be done., \"I must go, uncertain of my fate; but I shall return hither, or follow your party, as soon as possible., But,\" (in a deep tone,) \"it was not done for her., I walk: I prefer walking.\", But I too have been thinking over the past, and a question has suggested itself, whether there may not have been one person more my enemy even than that lady?, I do not think any young woman has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient to the principal part of her family, and be giving bad connections to those who have not been used to them., With the Musgroves, there was the happy chat of perfect ease; with Captain Harville, the kind-hearted intercourse of brother and sister; with Lady Russell, attempts at conversation, which a delicious consciousness cut short; with Admiral and Mrs Croft, everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest, which the same consciousness sought to conceal; and with Captain Wentworth, some moments of communications continually occurring, and always the hope of more, and always the knowledge of his being there., She had received ideas which disposed her to be courteous and kind to all, and to pity every one, as being less happy than herself., Accordingly their removal was made together, and Anne was set down at Uppercross Cottage, in the first stage of Lady Russell's journey., \"So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves, with this poor sick child; and not a creature coming near us all the evening!, Very, very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked in., He was not Mr Wentworth, the former curate of Monkford, however suspicious appearances may be, but a Captain Frederick Wentworth, his brother, who being made commander in consequence of the action off St Domingo, and not immediately employed, had come into Somersetshire, in the summer of 1806; and having no parent living, found a home for half a year at Monkford., Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan; and, as she went a little way with them, down the hill, still talking to Henrietta, Mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her, and saying to Captain Wentworth-- \"It is very unpleasant, having such connexions!, Precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer's hands; but Sir Walter had improved it by adding, for the information of himself and his family, these words, after the date of Mary's birth--, \"Yes, I made the best of it; I always do: but I was very far from well at the time; and I do not think I ever was so ill in my life as I have been all this morning: very unfit to be left alone, They had looked forward and arranged everything before the others began to reflect., Pray be so good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your whole party this evening., He had strong feelings of family attachment and family honour, without pride or weakness; he lived with the liberality of a man of fortune, without display; he judged for himself in everything essential, without defying public opinion in any point of worldly decorum., A few months hence, and the room now so deserted, occupied but by her silent, pensive self, might be filled again with all that was happy and gay, all that was glowing and bright in prosperous love, all that was most unlike Anne Elliot!, One can guess what will happen there., The name of Anne Elliot,\" said he, \"has long had an interesting sound to me., Will it make you happy?, There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remark about them in the Mansion-house; but it was different at the Cottage:, Mrs Croft was attending with great good-humour, and whenever she spoke at all, it was very sensibly., She was as much convinced of his meaning to gain Anne in time as of his deserving her, and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks which would free him from all the remaining restraints of widowhood, and leave him at liberty to exert his most open powers of pleasing., She did not imagine that her father had at present an idea of the kind., He had been remarkably handsome in his youth; and, at fifty-four, was still a very fine man., She could imagine Mrs Clay to have said, that \"now Miss Anne was come, she could not suppose herself at all wanted;\" for Elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper, \"That must not be any reason, indeed., \"I have been thinking over the past, and trying impartially to judge of the right and wrong, I mean with regard to myself; and I must believe that I was right, much as I suffered from it, that I was perfectly right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you do now., Mr Elliot was there; she avoided, but she could pity him., She is only nursing Mrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings; a mere pretty, silly, expensive, fashionable woman, I believe; and of course will have nothing to report but of lace and finery., My dearest Anne, it would give me more delight than is often felt at my time of life!\", \", She had a cultivated mind, and was, generally speaking, rational and consistent; but she had prejudices on the side of ancestry; she had a value for rank and consequence, which blinded her a little to the faults of those who possessed them., Bless me!, Mrs Smith looked at her again, looked earnestly, smiled, shook her head, and exclaimed--, In the intervals of the concert it was conversation., There is a quickness of perception in some, a nicety in the discernment of character, a natural penetration, in short, which no experience in others can equal, and Lady Russell had been less gifted in this part of understanding than her young friend., The profession has its utility, but I should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it.\", To her, its greatest interest must be, in having been very much talked of between her friend and Mr Elliot; in having been wished for, regretted, and at the same time honoured for staying away in such a cause., would I be turned back from doing a thing that I had determined to do, and that I knew to be right, by the airs and interference of such a person, or of any person I may say?, She felt herself ill-used and unfortunate, as did her father; and they were neither of them able to devise any means of lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity, or relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne., Here and there, human nature may be great in times of trial; but generally speaking, it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a sick chamber, He is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of justice or compassion., There was too much wind to make the high part of the new Cobb pleasant for the ladies, and they agreed to get down the steps to the lower, and all were contented to pass quietly and carefully down the steep flight, excepting Louisa; she must be jumped down them by Captain Wentworth., Anne found Captain Benwick again drawing near her., She received no other answer, than an artificial, assenting smile, followed by a contemptuous glance, as he turned away, which Anne perfectly knew the meaning of., Her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular., What is her age?, Anne was obliged to turn away, to rise, to walk to a distant table, and, leaning there in pretended employment, try to subdue the feelings this picture excited., Could it be Mr Elliot?, God forbid that I should undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my fellow-creatures!, Lady Russell was fond of Bath, in short, and disposed to think it must suit them all; and as to her young friend's health, by passing all the warm months with her at Kellynch Lodge, every danger would be avoided; and it was in fact, a change which must do both health and spirits good., She had seen him., Let those who would be happy be firm., She had little hope of success; but Elizabeth, who in the event of such a reverse would be so much more to be pitied than herself, should never, she thought, have reason to reproach her for giving no warning., Oh!, There were many other men about him, many groups walking the same way, but there was no mistaking him., We do not call Bermuda or Bahama, you know, the West Indies.\", And so, I made her go., No, no, some time or other, perhaps, but not now., \"Your feelings may be the strongest,\" replied Anne, \"but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender., I can hardly write., She is not satisfied., I saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of misery., Chapter 8 From this time Captain Wentworth and Anne Elliot were repeatedly in the same circle., She was most thankful for her own knowledge of him., This was almost cruel., \"Another time, Sir, I thank you, not now.\", Sir Walter thought much of Mrs Wallis; she was said to be an excessively pretty woman, beautiful. \", She, poor soul, is tied by the leg., Had she been using any thing in particular?\", I dare say I shall catch it; and my sore-throats, you know, are always worse than anybody's.\", But, alas!, I am very angry with you.\", He soon joined them again, successful, of course; Lady Dalrymple would be most happy to take them home, and would call for them in a few minutes., She hoped to be wise and reasonable in time; but alas!, In his preceding attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove (the attempts of angry pride), he protested that he had for ever felt it to be impossible, We had a famous set-to at rat-hunting all the morning in my father's great barns; and he played his part so well that I have liked him the better ever since., Who is your party?\", , I beg you would not hesitate to employ me.\", Mr Elliot was in Bath., Charles gave it for Louisa, Mary for Henrietta, but quite agreeing that to have him marry either could be extremely delightful., We are all very well pleased, however, for though it is not equal to her marrying Captain Wentworth, it is infinitely better than Charles Hayter; and Mr Musgrove has written his consent, and Captain Benwick is expected to-day., She could not speak the name, and look straight forward to Lady Russell's eye, till she had adopted the expedient of telling her briefly what she thought of the attachment between him and Louisa., \"I am no match-maker, as you well know,\" said Lady Russell, \"being much too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations., I heard it myself, and you were in the other room., \"Now you are taking nonsense, Mary,\" was therefore his answer., \"Go to him, go to him,\" cried Anne, \"for heaven's sake go to him., It holds nine., It was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd, who had returned, after an unprosperous marriage, to her father's house, with the additional burden of two children., Have you forgot that we are engaged to Camden Place to-morrow night?, The name of Musgrove would have told him enough., \" She did: he was satisfied, and said no more., He knows where a surgeon is to be found., Thirteen years had passed away since Lady Elliot's death, and they were still near neighbours and intimate friends, and one remained a widower, the other a widow., In the course of the same morning, Anne and her father chancing to be alone together, he began to compliment her on her improved looks; he thought her \"less thin in her person, in her cheeks; her skin, her complexion, greatly improved; clearer, fresher., Anne could not have supposed it possible that her first evening in Camden Place could have passed so well!, \"Yes; I did not see them myself, but I heard Mr Elliot say they were in the room.\", Each lady was previously well disposed for an agreement, and saw nothing, therefore, but, I meet them wherever I go; and I declare, I never go twice into my nursery without seeing something of them., You misled me by the term gentleman., If one happens only to shut the door a little hard, she starts and wriggles like a young dab-chick in the water; and Benwick sits at her elbow, reading verses, or whispering to her, all day long., \" Their first meeting in Milsom Street afforded much to be said, but the concert still more., who, by-the-bye, had a great curiosity to see you, and was delighted to be in the way to let you in., For the first time, since their renewed acquaintance, she felt that she was betraying the least sensibility of the two., Uppercross excited no interest, Kellynch very little: it was all Bath., Captain Benwick is very well, I believe, but he is a very odd young man., They had by dint of being so very much together, got to speak to each other with a considerable portion of apparent indifference and calmness; but he could not do it now., Anne, seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it, did as she was desired., Was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind you, was not the recollection of what had been, the knowledge of her influence,, He had not been known to them as a boy; but soon after Lady Elliot's death, Sir Walter had sought the acquaintance, and though his overtures had not been met with any warmth, he had persevered in seeking it, making allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth; and, in one of their spring excursions to London, when Elizabeth was in her first bloom, Mr Elliot had been forced into the introduction., Oh!, \"We had your sister's card yesterday, and I understood Frederick had a card too, though I did not see it; and you are disengaged, Frederick, are you not, as well as ourselves?\", I assure you, Miss Anne, it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as I otherwise should., My cousin Anne shakes her head., I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence pay his addresses to you, and if you should be disposed to accept him, I think there would be every possibility of your being happy together., It came from Mr Elliot., My brother,\" whispered one of the girls; \"mamma is thinking of poor Richard.\", The Crofts who rent Kellynch?, You can make little Charles do anything; he always minds you at a word., Anne Elliot, with all her claims of birth, beauty, and mind, to throw herself away at nineteen; involve herself at nineteen in an engagement with a young man, who had nothing but himself to recommend him, and no hopes of attaining affluence, but in the chances of a most uncertain profession, and no connexions to secure even his farther rise in the profession, would be, indeed, a throwing away, which she grieved to think of!, Michaelmas came; and now Anne's heart must be in Kellynch again., In half a minute Charles was at the bottom of Union Street again, and the other two proceeding together: and soon words enough had passed between them to decide their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel walk, where the power of conversation would make the present hour a blessing indeed, and prepare it for all the immortality which the happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow., ay,--Mr Wentworth, the curate of Monkford., They played me a pitiful trick once: got away with some of my best men., Yes, indeed, oh yes!, \"I declare, Charles, I never heard him mention Anne twice all the time I was there., You need not tell me that you had a pleasant evening., so ill bear a comparison, or the perfect unrivalled hold it possessed over his own., She had been repeatedly very earnest in trying to get Anne included in the visit to London, sensibly open to all the injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut her out, and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give Elizabeth the advantage of her own better judgement and experience; but always in vain: Elizabeth would go her own way; and never had she pursued it in more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in this selection of Mrs Clay; turning from the society of so deserving a sister, to bestow her affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her but the object of distant civility., To spare Henrietta from agitation seemed the governing principle., She could soon sit upright on the sofa, and began to hope she might be able to leave it by dinner-time., A larger society would improve them., They brought with them their country habit of being almost always together., Lady Russell took her out in her carriage almost every morning, and she never failed to think of them, and never failed to see them., I was dreadfully alarmed yesterday, but the case is very different to-day.\", Well,\" (turning away), \"now, where are you bound?, But these measures, however good in themselves, were insufficient for the real extent of the evil, the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged to confess to her soon afterwards., \"Charles may say what he pleases,\" cried Mary to Anne, as soon as he was out of the room, \"but it would be shocking to have Henrietta marry Charles Hayter; a very bad thing for her, and still worse for me; and therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth may soon put him quite out of her head, and I have very little doubt that he has., Anne smiled and said, \"My idea of good company, Mr Elliot, is the company of clever, well-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation; that is what I call good company.\", Anne found in Mrs Smith the good sense and agreeable manners which she had almost ventured to depend on, and a disposition to converse and be cheerful beyond her expectation., This was agreed upon between the two friends as the only thing to be done; and Colonel Wallis was to assist in every way that he could., \", , why should it be an object to him?, Louisa had once opened her eyes, but soon closed them again, without apparent consciousness., It suits us very well., but I should think, Miss Elliot,\" (looking with serious reflection), \"I should think he must be rather a dressy man for his time of life., At the end of that period, Lady Russell's politeness could repose no longer, and the fainter self-threatenings of the past became in a decided tone, \"I must call on Mrs Croft; I really must call upon her soon., \"She had seemed to recommend and praise him!\", She was looking remarkably well;, As it was, she instantly submitted, and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond; and Anne, eager to escape farther notice, was impatient to know why Mrs Smith should have fancied she was to marry Mr Elliot; where she could have received the idea, or from whom she could have heard it., Instead of pushing his fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot, he had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of inferior birth., I found them on the most friendly terms when I arrived.\", It had been a great disappointment to Mr Musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed, so impatient was he to shew his gratitude, by seeing Captain Wentworth under his own roof, and welcoming him to all that was strongest and best in his cellars., They were people whom her heart turned to very naturally., But neither Charles Hayter's feelings, nor anybody's feelings, could interest her, till she had a little better arranged her own., \"No,\" said Anne, \"that I can easily believe to be impossible; but in time, perhaps--we know what time does in every case of affliction, and you must remember, Captain Harville, that your friend may yet be called a young mourner--only last summer, I understand.\", They were sick with horror, while he examined; but he was not hopeless., Once so much to each other!, \"She would have turned back then, but for you?\", She had promised to be with the Musgroves from breakfast to dinner., And yet here are two gentlemen stuck up in it mightily at their ease, and looking about them at the rocks and mountains, as if they were not to be upset the next moment, which they certainly must be., those were pleasant days when I had the Laconia!, She wished it might be possible for her to avoid ever seeing Captain Wentworth at the Hall: those rooms had witnessed former meetings which would be brought too painfully before her; but she was yet more anxious for the possibility of Lady Russell and Captain Wentworth never meeting anywhere., Now they were as strangers; nay, worse than strangers, for they could never become acquainted., Captain Harville, who had in truth been hearing none of it, now left his seat, and moved to a window, and Anne seeming to watch him, though it was from thorough absence of mind, became gradually sensible that he was inviting her to join him where he stood., She has abilities, however, as well as affections; and it is now a doubtful point whether his cunning, or hers, may finally carry the day; whether, after preventing her from being the wife of Sir Walter, he may not be wheedled and caressed at last into making her the wife of Sir William., \"Do you mean that she refused him?\", There could be no doubt as to Miss Elliot., \"You sent me such a good account of yourself on Thursday!\", Dare say you heard the carriage, sir, while you were at dinner; and going on now for Crewkherne, in his way to Bath and London.\", Chapter 17, It had been my doing, solely mine., She and the Harvilles came on Tuesday very safely, and in the evening we went to ask her how she did,, Elliot., Mr Hayter had some property of his own, but it was insignificant compared with Mr Musgrove's; and while the Musgroves were in the first class of society in the country, the young Hayters would, from their parents' inferior, retired, and unpolished way of living, and their own defective education, have been hardly in any class at all, but for their connexion with Uppercross, this eldest son of course excepted, who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman, and who was very superior in cultivation and manners to all the rest., Hitherto there had been, She felt that he had every thing to elevate him which general attention and deference, and especially the attention of all the young women, could do., Brigden stares to see anybody with me but my wife., They came: the master of the house was not at home, but the two sisters were together; and as it chanced that Mrs Croft fell to the share of Anne, while the Admiral sat by Mary, and made himself very agreeable by his good-humoured notice of her little boys, I have now, as far as such a sentiment is allowable in human nature, nothing to reproach myself with; and if I mistake not, a strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman's portion.\", \"I had no more discoveries to make than you would have as to the fashion and strength of any old pelisse, which you had seen lent about among half your acquaintance ever since you could remember, and which at last, on some very wet day, is lent to yourself., Anne did not share these feelings., It had increased her comforts by making her feel herself to be in good hands., She said nothing, therefore, till he was out of the room, but as soon as there was only Anne to hear--, Give him a book, and he will read all day long.\", To your fine mind, I well know the sight of beauty is a real gratification.\", Anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches., He was in orders; and having a curacy in the neighbourhood, where residence was not required, lived at his father's house, only two miles from Uppercross., No, you would not guess, from his way of writing, that he had ever thought of this Miss (what's her name?) for himself., He was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys, clinging to him like an old friend, and declaring he should not go; and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets, &c., to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had begun, Anne was left to persuade herself, as well as she could, that the same brother must still be in question., I have been used to the gratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that I enjoyed., \"These would have been all my friends,\" was her thought; and she had to struggle against a great tendency to lowness., All this is much, very much in favour of their happiness; more than perhaps--\" He stopped., \", a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant;, Sir Walter talked of his youngest daughter; \"Mr Elliot must give him leave to present him to his youngest daughter\", \" She could have said more on the subject; for she had in fact so high an opinion of the Crofts, and considered her father so very fortunate in his tenants, felt the parish to be so sure of a good example, and the poor of the best attention and relief, that however sorry and ashamed for the necessity of the removal, she could not but in conscience feel that they were gone who deserved not to stay, and that Kellynch Hall had passed into better hands than its owners'., What, in heaven's name, is to be done next?\", When the distressing communication at Uppercross was over, and he had seen the father and mother quite as composed as could be hoped, and the daughter all the better for being with them, he announced his intention of returning in the same carriage to Lyme; and when the horses were baited, he was off., How was the truth to reach him?, He had remained in Shropshire, lamenting the blindness of his own pride, and the blunders of his own calculations, till at once released from Louisa by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her engagement with Benwick. \", She made no reply., The first three or four days passed most quietly, with no circumstance to mark them excepting the receipt of a note or two from Lyme, which found their way to Anne, she could not tell how, and brought a rather improving account of Louisa., \"I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present, will furnish much either to interest or edify me., I hope his letter does not breathe the spirit of an ill-used man.\", Captain Benwick came not, however., It is bad for him, I know, to be shut up as he is; but what can we do?, \", \" She could not immediately have uttered another sentence; her heart was too full, her breath too much oppressed., They talk and laugh a great deal too much for me., ; do mention all about him.\", \"Yes, I have, presently., \", They were both silent: Mrs Smith very thoughtful., My own self., No hurry for a signal at all., She was ashamed of herself, quite ashamed of being so nervous, so overcome by such a trifle; but so it was, and it required a long application of solitude and reflection to recover her., , her father had found little to admire in her, (so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own), there could be nothing in them, now that she was faded and thin, to excite his esteem., She had this communication, moreover, from Mary. \", They were gone, she hoped, to be happy, however oddly constructed such happiness might seem; as for herself, she was left with as many sensations of comfort, as were, perhaps, ever likely to be hers., To me, who live so much alone, her conversation, I assure you, is a treat.\", the years which had destroyed her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing, manly, open look, in no respect lessening his personal advantages., The undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for Sir Walter was certainly much strengthened by one part, and a very material part of the scheme, which had been happily engrafted on the beginning., \", He was the intimate friend of my dear husband, who trusted and loved him, and thought him as good as himself., I do not know what he would be at., Mrs Smith gave her a penetrating glance, and then, smiling, said--, yes, perhaps, it had been Mr Elliot., As for herself, she might always command a home with Lady Russell., What instances must pass before them of ardent, disinterested, self-denying attachment, of heroism, fortitude, patience, resignation: of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices that ennoble us most., If he should rise to any very great honours!, She left it all behind her, all but the recollection that such things had been., \", The name of Walter I can drop, thank God!, How eloquent could Anne Elliot have been!, Elizabeth could not conceive how such an absurd suspicion should occur to her, and indignantly answered for each party's perfectly knowing their situation. \", While they were speaking, a whispering between her father and Elizabeth caught her ear., Oh!, Mrs Clay was very pleasant, and very smiling, but her courtesies and smiles were more a matter of course., They were come too late in the year for any amusement or variety, She assured him that she had not., It was a fine family-piece., The party drove off in very good spirits; Sir Walter prepared with condescending bows for all the afflicted tenantry and cottagers who might have had a hint to show themselves, and Anne walked up at the same time, in a sort of desolate tranquillity, to the Lodge, where she was to spend the first week., How can you be so forgetful?\", He had never had an idea of throwing himself off; he had feared that he was thrown off, but knew not why, and delicacy had kept him silent., With regard to Charles Hayter, she had delicacy which must be pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning young woman, and a heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned; but if Henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her feelings, the alternation could not be understood too soon., Ten minutes were enough to certify that., They had Mr Elliot too., Anne hoped the gentlemen might each be too much self-occupied to hear. \", I am very little disposed to grant a tenant of Kellynch Hall any extraordinary favour, I assure you, be he sailor or soldier.\", I think not., The answer soon presented itself., Not a puncture, not a weak spot anywhere., Of all the family, Mary was probably the one most immediately gratified by the circumstance., Anne suppressed a smile, and listened kindly, while Mrs Musgrove relieved her heart a little more; and for a few minutes, therefore, could not keep pace with the conversation of the others., But, Anne, only conceive how extraordinary!, without partiality; but Mrs Charles knows no more how they should be treated--!, It was evident that the report concerning her had spread, and a short pause succeeded, which seemed to ensure that it would now spread farther., In two minutes after Charles's preparation, the others appeared; they were in the drawing-room., This,\" said she, \"is nearly the sense, or rather the meaning of the words, for certainly the sense of an Italian love-song must not be talked of, but it is as nearly the meaning as I can give; for I do not pretend to understand the language., `Forty,' replied Sir Basil, `forty, and no more.', ; I shall not easily forget Admiral Baldwin., Sir Walter only nodded., \", She had not mistaken him., Bless me!, \"Ah!, And it was soon over., Anne found an unexpected interest here., Charles wonders what Captain Wentworth will say; but if you remember, I never thought him attached to Louisa; I never could see anything of it., Every minute is valuable., But now, do not stand upon ceremony., Anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going., You have difficulties, and privations, and dangers enough to struggle with., She had been forced into prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older: the natural sequel of an unnatural beginning., She felt that she could so much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked or said a careless or a hasty thing, than of those whose presence of mind never varied, whose tongue never slipped., The scheme had received its first impulse by Captain Harville's wanting to come to Bath on business., there was no getting away from one's self., There he had seen everything to exalt in his estimation the woman he had lost; and there begun to deplore the pride, the folly, the madness of resentment, which had kept him from trying to regain her when thrown in his way., He did not mean to complain, however., -- \"Dear Smith,--I have received yours., Her brother's return was the first comfort; he could take best care of his wife; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary., When their places were determined on, and they were all properly arranged, she looked round to see if he should happen to be in the same part of the room, but he was not; her eye could not reach him; and the concert being just opening, she must consent for a time to be happy in a humbler way., She had soon the mortification of seeing Mr Elliot withdraw, and no one of proper condition has since presented himself to raise even the unfounded hopes which sunk with him., Time had changed him, or Louisa had changed him., Upon the hint of having spoken disrespectfully or carelessly of the family and the family honours, he was quite indignant., \" This was an opportunity which Anne could not resist; she said, therefore, \"I hope, Admiral, I hope there is nothing in the style of Captain Wentworth's letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly uneasy., The worst of Bath was the number of its plain women., Anne longed for the power of representing to them all what they were about, and of pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to., \"Quite delightful!\" cried Mrs Clay, not daring, however, to turn her eyes towards Anne., He and his wife had taken their intended drive, and were returning home., \"Have you finished your letter?\" said Captain Harville., Henrietta was exactly in that state of recently-improved views, of fresh-formed happiness, which made her full of regard and interest for everybody she had ever liked before at all; and Mrs Musgrove's real affection had been won by her usefulness when they were in distress., She looked down very decidedly upon the Hayters, and thought it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between the families renewed--very sad for herself and her children., She persisted in a very determined, though very silent disinclination for Bath; caught the first dim view of the extensive buildings, smoking in rain, without any wish of seeing them better; felt their progress through the streets to be, however disagreeable, yet too rapid; for who would be glad to see her when she arrived?, Everything that revolts other people, low company, paltry rooms, foul air, I should like to know why you imagine I am?\", The offence which had been given her father, many years back, she knew; Elizabeth's particular share in it she suspected; and that Mr Elliot's idea always produced irritation in both was beyond a doubt., He had enquired after her, she found, particularly; had expressed his hope of Miss Elliot's not being the worse for her exertions, and had spoken of those exertions as great., it was,\" Charles added: \"only five-and-twenty miles from Uppercross, and in a very fine country:, But this, no doubt, you have been always doing., A little disordered always the first twenty-four hours of going to sea, but never knew what sickness was afterwards., very well; time will explain., What glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister!, \", When the Crofts called this morning, (they called here afterwards, did not they?), Anne had called several times on her friend, before the existence of such a person was known in Camden Place., The Crofts must be in Bath!, They had been a year or two waiting for fortune and promotion., Anne, really tired herself, was glad to sit down; and she very soon heard Captain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedge-row, behind her, as if making their way back along the rough, wild sort of channel, down the centre., In fact, as I have long been convinced, though every profession is necessary and honourable in its turn, it is only the lot of those who are not obliged to follow any, who can live in a regular way, in the country, choosing their own hours, following their own pursuits, and living on their own property, without the torment of trying for more; it is only their lot, I say, to hold the blessings of health and a good appearance to the utmost: I know no other set of men but what lose something of their personableness when they cease to be quite young., He had spoken to her with some degree of openness of Mrs Clay; had appeared completely to see what Mrs Clay was about, and to hold her in contempt; and yet Mrs Clay found him as agreeable as any body., none., a man of decent appearance produced., She had only meant to oppose the too common idea of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other, not at all to represent Captain Benwick's manners as the very best that could possibly be; and, after a little hesitation, she was beginning to say, \"I was not entering into any comparison of the two friends,\" but the Admiral interrupted her with-- \", She tried to be calm, and leave things to take their course, and tried to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence:--, A letter from his friend, Captain Harville, having found him out at last, had brought intelligence of Captain Harville's being settled with his family at Lyme for the winter; of their being therefore, quite unknowingly, within twenty miles of each other., The difference between his present air and what it had been in the Octagon Room was strikingly great., Be it known then, that Sir Walter, like a good father, (having met with one or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications), prided himself on remaining single for his dear daughters' sake., Do look at it., A very good man, and very much the gentleman, Anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could supply from Lady Russell., He might have been in Mr Elliot's company, but she had not courage to ask the question., Such personal praise might have struck her, especially as it did not appear to Anne that the freckles were at all lessened., My best love, of course.\", He gave her a momentary glance, a glance of brightness, which seemed to say, \"That man is struck with you, and even I, at this moment, see something like Anne Elliot again.\", Mr Elliot had attempted no apology, and shewn himself as unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family, as Sir Walter considered him unworthy of it: all acquaintance between them had ceased., girls, the two eldest sixteen and fourteen, was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath, an awful charge rather, to confide to the authority and guidance of a conceited, silly father., Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman, that his love has an earlier death., There had been music, singing, talking, laughing, all that was most agreeable; charming manners in Captain Wentworth, no shyness or reserve; they seemed all to know each other perfectly, and he was coming the very next morning to shoot with Charles., She was sure that he had not been happy in marriage., \"Indeed, my dear Mrs Smith, I want none,\" cried Anne., and unfortunately\" (speaking low and tremulously), The only wonder was, what they could be waiting for, till the business at Lyme came, It was a struggle between propriety and vanity; but vanity got the better, and then Elizabeth was happy again., But indeed, my dear, you need not be uneasy., He had not forgiven Anne Elliot., \"Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man, and in many respects I think highly of him,\" said Anne; \"but we should not suit., He omitted no opportunity of being with them, threw himself in their way, called at all hours; but I need not be particular on this subject., She meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke a remonstrance on his side., They were gradually acquainted, and when acquainted, rapidly and deeply in love., Can I be of any use?\", She had a large acquaintance, of course professionally, among those who can afford to buy, and she disposes of my merchandise., I see you know nothing of the matter., But I cannot believe it of you., He would be as little incumbrance as possible to Captain and Mrs Harville; but as to leaving his sister in such a state, he neither ought, nor would., I can support her myself., And then, if I could convey to you the glow of his soul when he does see them again; when, coming back after a twelvemonth's absence, perhaps, and obliged to put into another port, he calculates how soon it be possible to get them there, pretending to deceive himself, and saying, `They cannot be here till such a day,' but all the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner, and seeing them arrive at last, as if Heaven had given them wings, by many hours sooner still!, Mr Elliot was better to look at than most men, and he had no objection to being seen with him anywhere.\", Anne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking herself; but it so happened that one morning, about a week or ten days after the Croft's arrival, it suited her best to leave her friend, or her friend's carriage, in the lower part of the town, and return alone to Camden Place, and in walking up Milsom Street she had the good fortune to meet with the Admiral., He little surmised that it was a subject acting now exactly against his interest, bringing immediately to her thoughts all those parts of his conduct which were least excusable., What wild imaginations, He was gone; he had disappeared, she felt a moment's regret., I could never doubt that you would be loved and sought by others, but I knew to a certainty that you had refused one man, at least, of better pretensions than myself; and I could not help often saying, `Was this for me?', Let him know me to be a friend of yours, and then he will think little of the trouble required, which it is very natural for him now, with so many affairs and engagements of his own, to avoid and get rid of as he can; very natural, perhaps., \"I presume to observe, Sir Walter, that, in the way of business, gentlemen of the navy are well to deal with., \", I trust to being in charity with her soon., I wish you had been with us yesterday, for then you might have decided between us; and I am sure you would have thought as I did, unless you had been determined to give it against me.\", Do you think this is a good plan?, \" They all met, and were introduced., \"Intimately.\", The rooms were shut up, the lodgers almost all gone, scarcely any family but of the residents left; and, as there is nothing to admire in the buildings themselves, the remarkable situation of the town, the principal street almost hurrying into the water, the walk to the Cobb, skirting round the pleasant little bay, which, in the season, is animated with bathing machines and company; the Cobb itself, its old wonders and new improvements, with the very beautiful line of cliffs stretching out to the east of the town, are what the stranger's eye will seek; and a very strange stranger it must be, who does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme, to make him wish to know it better., He is always with them; half lives in the family, I believe., The holidays, however, are over at last: I believe no children ever had such long ones., Scenes had passed in Uppercross which made it precious., It was now proved that he belonged to the same inn as themselves; and this second meeting, short as it was, also proved again by the gentleman's looks, that he thought hers very lovely, and by the readiness and propriety of his apologies, that he was a man of exceedingly good manners., Without emulating the feelings of an Emma towards her Henry, she would have attended on Louisa with a zeal above the common claims of regard, for his sake; and she hoped he would not long be so unjust as to suppose she would shrink unnecessarily from the office of a friend., So, there was I, crowded into the back seat with Henrietta and Louise; and I think it very likely that my illness to-day may be owing to it., His genius and ardour had seemed to foresee and to command his prosperous path., But perhaps if she were to leave the room vacant, we might not be invited., Mr Elliot is a man without heart or conscience; a designing, wary, cold-blooded being, who thinks only of himself; whom for his own interest or ease, would be guilty of any cruelty, or any treachery, that could be perpetrated without risk of his general character., \"Merely Gowland,\" he supposed., Mary had acquired a little artificial importance, by becoming Mrs Charles Musgrove; but Anne, with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character, which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding, was nobody with either father or sister; her word had no weight, her convenience was always to give way--, It is a thing of course among us, that every man is refused, till he offers., She is fastidious., At present, believe me, I have no need of your services, being in cash again., You saw how hysterical I was yesterday.\", She rated Lady Russell's influence highly; and as to the severe degree of self-denial which her own conscience prompted, she believed there might be little more difficulty in persuading them to a complete, than to half a reformation., \" Anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with partiality of her many years ago as the Mr Wentworth of Monkford, Captain Wentworth's brother., All his sanguine expectations, all his confidence had been justified., He is worse than last year., She played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves, but having no voice, no knowledge of the harp, and no fond parents, to sit by and fancy themselves delighted, her performance was little thought of, only out of civility, or to refresh the others, as she was well aware., You will tell Sir Walter what we have done, and that Mr Shepherd thinks it the greatest improvement the house ever had., To Anne, it chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation., And, indeed, to own the truth, I do not think nurse, Where can you look for a more suitable match?, In every other respect, in looking around her, or penetrating forward, she saw more to distrust and to apprehend., , her grandfather had been a butcher, but that was all nothing., on Tuesday night, he made a very awkward sort of excuse; `he never shot' and he had `been quite misunderstood,' and he had promised this and he had promised that, and, those letters are convenient passports., Wentworth; Captain Wentworth of the navy., Charles \"had never seen a pleasanter man in his life; and from what he had once heard Captain Wentworth himself say, was very sure that he had not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war., Captain Harville had taken his present house for half a year; his taste, and his health, and his fortune, all directing him to a residence inexpensive, and by the sea; and the grandeur of the country, and the retirement of Lyme in the winter, appeared exactly adapted to Captain Benwick's state of mind., Oh!, \"You know,\" said she, \"I cannot think him at all a fit match for Henrietta; and considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made, she has no right to throw herself away., The younger boy, a remarkable stout, forward child, of two years old, having got the door opened for him by some one without, made his determined appearance among them, and went straight to the sofa to see what was going on, and put in his claim to anything good that might be giving away., She had the remembrance of all this, she had the consciousness of being nine-and-twenty to give her some regrets and some apprehensions; she was fully satisfied of being still quite as handsome as ever, but she felt her approach to the years of danger, and would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by baronet-blood within the next twelvemonth or two., ; for the Dalrymples (in Anne's opinion, most unfortunately) were cousins of the Elliots; and the agony was how to introduce themselves properly., \"No,\" replied Anne, in a low, feeling voice., Anne felt that she did not belong to the conversation, and yet, as Captain Harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk, she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars; such as, \"how Mr Musgrove and my brother Hayter had met again and again to talk it over; what my brother Hayter had said one day, and what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next, and what had occurred to my sister Hayter, and what the young people had wished, and what I said at first I never could consent to, but was afterwards persuaded to think might do very well,\" and a great deal in the same style of open-hearted communication: minutiae which, even with every advantage of taste and delicacy, which good Mrs Musgrove could not give, could be properly interesting only to the principals., Oh!, Surely this must be calm enough., We see nothing of them, and this is really an instance of gross inattention., Everything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth; nothing could be plainer; and where many divisions were necessary, or even where they were not, they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two., , there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the Harvilles, and she had got books from the library, and changed them so often, that the balance had certainly been much in favour of Lyme., They had each had money, but their marriages had made a material difference in their degree of consequence., Lady Dalrymple, Lady Dalrymple,\" was the rejoicing sound; and with all the eagerness compatible with anxious elegance, Sir Walter and his two ladies stepped forward to meet her., Thank God!, Her removal was impossible., To hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth, repeating his name so often, puzzling over past years, and at last ascertaining that it might, that it probably would, turn out to be the very same Captain Wentworth whom they recollected meeting, once or twice, after their coming back from Clifton--a very fine young man--but they could not say whether it was seven or eight years ago, was a new sort of trial to Anne's nerves., But I beg your pardon; I have interrupted you., We told you about the laundry-door, at Uppercross., Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea, as nurse tells me, that it is to be put into the marriage articles when you and Mr Elliot marry, that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay., Anne understood it., She had a great deal to listen to; all the particulars of past sad scenes, all the minutiae of distress upon distress, which in former conversations had been merely hinted at, were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence., She had never in her life been more astonished., If it were war now, he would have settled it long ago., A widow Mrs Smith; and who was her husband?, The Admiral abused him for his want of gallantry., But she was very anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him and Elizabeth., She had no dread of these two months., Colonel Wallis declined sitting down again, and Mr Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret, in a manner not to be refused, to sit between them; and by some other removals, and a little scheming of her own, Anne was enabled to place herself much nearer the end of the bench than she had been before, much more within reach of a passer-by., They had drawn back from many introductions, and still were perpetually having cards left by people of whom they knew nothing., Excellent fellow., His head is full of some books that he is reading upon your recommendation, and he wants to talk to you about them; he has found out something or other in one of them which he thinks--, How I do wish I knew what you were at!, Chapter 19, And with a quivering lip he wound up the whole by adding, \"Poor Fanny!, She had given him up to oblige others., Charles laughed., more exactly what he ought to be than Mr Elliot; nor did she ever enjoy a sweeter feeling than the hope of seeing him receive the hand of her beloved Anne in Kellynch church, in the course of the following autumn., This nut,\" he continued, with playful solemnity, \"while so many of his brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot, is still in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be supposed capable of.\", I hope your father and mother are quite happy with regard to both.\", Anne heard her, and made no violent exclamations; she only smiled, blushed, and gently shook her head., And so you must judge for yourself, whether it would be better for you to go about the house or not., \"We shall never agree upon this question,\" Captain Harville was beginning to say, when a slight noise called their attention to Captain Wentworth's hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room., And Mrs Musgrove took the first opportunity of being alone with Anne, to say, \"Oh!, A word, a look, will be enough to decide whether I enter your father's house this evening or never., She had seen too much of the world, to expect sudden or disinterested attachment anywhere, but her illness had proved to her that her landlady had a character to preserve, and would not use her ill; and she had been particularly fortunate in her nurse, as a sister of her landlady, a nurse by profession, and who had always a home in that house when unemployed, chanced to be at liberty just in time to attend her. \", There was no triumph, no pitiful triumph in his manner., Let me plead for my--present friend I cannot call him, but for my former friend., He had the curacy of Monkford, you know, Sir Walter, some time back, for two or three years., I should not go, you may be sure, if I did not feel quite at ease about my dear child., But by coolly giving the reins a better direction herself they happily passed the danger; and by once afterwards judiciously putting out her hand they neither fell into a rut, nor ran foul of a dung-cart; and Anne, with some amusement at their style of driving, which she imagined no bad representation of the general guidance of their affairs, found herself safely deposited by them at the Cottage., \", Indeed, Mrs Harville and I quite agree that we love her the better for having nursed her., She was a widow and poor., \"I beg your pardon, madam, this is your seat;\" and though she immediately drew back with a decided negative, he was not to be induced to sit down again., It was the beginning of February; and Anne, having been a month in Bath, was growing very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme., When the plan was made known to Mary, however, there was an end of all peace in it., The Musgroves could hardly be more ready to invite than he to come, particularly in the morning, when he had no companion at home, for the Admiral and Mrs Croft were generally out of doors together, interesting themselves in their new possessions, their grass, and their sheep, and dawdling about in a way not endurable to a third person, or driving out in a gig, lately added to their establishment., He sat down with them, and improved their conversation very much., , this was all clear enough., my father's next heir?, \"Perhaps I shall., \"Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove,\" exclaimed Anne, \"should be happy in their children's marriages., But, if I know myself,\" said he, \"this is from no want of gallantry towards them., It was the same, the very same man, with no difference but of dress., \"You will wonder,\" said she, \"what has been fixing my eye so long; but I was looking after some window-curtains, which Lady Alicia and Mrs Frankland were telling me of last night., Her early impressions were incurable., I deserved none., It would not be fair; and yet you ought to have proof, for what is all this but assertion, and you shall have proof.\", it is over!\", One hates to be officious, to be giving bad impressions, making mischief., and I dare say it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Musgrove; put her quite out of her way., Ah!, Mrs Harville was a very experienced nurse, and her nursery-maid, who had lived with her long, and gone about with her everywhere, was just such another., At last Miss Elliot and her friend, unattended but by the servant, (for there was no cousin returned), were walking off; and Captain Wentworth, watching them, turned again to Anne, and by manner, rather than words, was offering his services to her., Her character was now fixed on his mind as perfection itself, maintaining the loveliest medium of fortitude and gentleness; but he was obliged to acknowledge that only at Uppercross had he learnt to do her justice, and only at Lyme had he begun to understand himself., \"You have had your little boys with you?\", And to go home without Charles, too, without her husband!, If he really sought to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch, he must be forgiven for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree., \"He would be a very lucky man, Shepherd,\" replied Sir Walter;, one should meet with., Mrs Smith gave a most good-humoured acquiescence., She was earnestly begged to return and dine, and give them all the rest of the day, but her spirits had been so long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more, and fit only for home, where she might be sure of being as silent as she chose., I hardly looked at him, certainly,\" was his daughter's; but Sir Walter's remark was, soon afterwards-- \", She had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel, and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law., A very fine woman with a large fortune, in love with him!, \", He did justice to his very gentlemanlike appearance, his air of elegance and fashion, his good shaped face, his sensible eye; but, at the same time, \"must lament his being very much under-hung, a defect which time seemed to have increased; nor could he pretend to say that ten years had not altered almost every feature for the worse., He was to be introduced, and Mrs Wallis was to be introduced, and everybody was to be introduced., Their concerns had been sunk under those of Uppercross; and when Lady Russell reverted to their former hopes and fears, and spoke her satisfaction in the house in Camden Place, which had been taken, and her regret that Mrs Clay should still be with them, Anne would have been ashamed to have it known how much more, Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret--they would soon be innoxious cousins to her., She never could accept him., She spoke to him, ordered, entreated, and insisted in vain., but I think it might be a very happy one.\", You need not be afraid, Miss Elliot, of your own sweet flower gardens being neglected.\", My dear Anne,--I make no apology for my silence, because I know how little people think of letters in such a place as Bath., Poor Frederick!, The disproportion in their fortune was nothing; it did not give her a moment's regret; but to have no family to receive and estimate him properly, nothing of respectability, of harmony, of good will to offer in return for all the worth and all the prompt welcome which met her in his brothers and sisters, was a source of as lively pain as her mind could well be sensible of under circumstances of otherwise strong felicity., \"Did you go then?, Henrietta fully thought so herself, before Captain Wentworth came; but from that time Cousin Charles had been very much forgotten., Morning visits are never fair by women at her time of life, who make themselves up so little., Pretty well, ma'am in the fifteen years of my marriage; though many women have done more., Anne had gone unhappy to school, grieving for the loss of a mother whom she had dearly loved, feeling her separation from home, and suffering as a girl of fourteen, of strong sensibility and not high spirits, must suffer at such a time; and Miss Hamilton, three years older than herself, but still from the want of near relations and a settled home, remaining another year at school, had been useful and good to her in a way which had considerably lessened her misery, and could never be remembered with indifference., I did not think Charles would have been so unfeeling., But, I assure you, I have never been in the house above twice in my life.\", That was a point which Anne had not been able to avoid suspecting before; and instead of drawing the same conclusion as Mary, from the present course of events, they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself., She tried to dissuade Mary from going, but in vain; and that being the case, thought it best to accept the Miss Musgroves' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise, as she might be useful in turning back with her sister, and lessening the interference in any plan of their own., \"Oh! no, that is clear enough., : they are all knocked about, and exposed to every climate, and every weather, till they are not fit to be seen., She was just in time to see him turn into the Concert Room., Elizabeth, though resenting the suspicion, might yet be made observant by it., Then might she again take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her early youth, but now she liked it not., The others will be here presently.\", The moment of her stepping forward in the Octagon Room to speak to him: the moment of Mr Elliot's appearing and tearing her away, and one or two subsequent moments, marked by returning hope or increasing despondency, were dwelt on with energy., (laughing heartily); \"I would not venture over a horsepond in it., A lady, without a family, was the very best preserver of furniture in the world., \"Perhaps,\" said Mr Elliot, speaking low, \"I have had a longer acquaintance with your character than you are aware of.\", These convictions must unquestionably have their own pain, and severe was its kind; but they precluded that pain which Lady Russell would suffer in entering the house again, and returning through the well-known apartments., Anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent; but she had ceased to endeavour to check it, from believing that, though there were on each side continual subjects of offence, neither family could now do without it., Do not you think, Miss Elliot, we had better try to get him to Bath?\", I suppose he was afraid of finding it dull; but upon my word I should have thought we were lively enough at the Cottage for such a heart-broken man as Captain Benwick.\", \"The last time I saw her she had a red nose, but I hope that may not happen every day.\", Though it was rather desirable that Mr and Mrs Musgrove should be previously alarmed by some share of delay; yet the time required by the Uppercross horses to take them back, would be a dreadful extension of suspense; and Captain Wentworth proposed, and Charles Musgrove agreed, that it would be much better for him to take a chaise from the inn, and leave Mr Musgrove's carriage and horses to be sent home the next morning early, when there would be the farther advantage of sending an account of Louisa's night., \"Certainly., , could I have read your feelings, as I think you must have penetrated mine., Lady Russell had little taste for wit, and of anything approaching to imprudence a horror., It might be him, perhaps., It could not be very lasting, however., She often told herself it was folly, before she could harden her nerves sufficiently to feel the continual discussion of the Crofts and their business no evil., The husband had not been what he ought, and the wife had been led among that part of mankind which made her think worse of the world than she hoped it deserved., That he was a sensible man, an agreeable man, that he talked well, professed good opinions, seemed to judge properly and as a man of principle, It was not merely complaisance, it must be a liking to the cause, which made him enter warmly into her father and sister's solicitudes on a subject which she thought unworthy to excite them., I have engaged Captain Wentworth., I got more acquainted with him last Monday than ever I did before., This was the page at which the favourite volume always opened: \"ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL. \", They knew not each other's opinion, either its constancy or its change, on the one leading point of Anne's conduct, for the subject was never alluded to; but Anne, at seven-and-twenty, thought very differently from what she had been made to think at nineteen., \", for certainly, coming as she did, with a heart full of the subject which had been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks, she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found in the separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Musgrove: \", Jealousy of Mr Elliot!, If he were a little spoilt by such universal, such eager admiration, who could wonder?, Captain Wentworth talked of going there again himself, it was only seventeen miles from Uppercross; though November, the weather was by no means bad; and, in short, Louisa, who was the most eager of the eager, having formed the resolution to go, and besides the pleasure of doing as she liked, being now armed with the idea of merit in maintaining her own way, bore down all the wishes of her father and mother for putting it off till summer; and to Lyme they were to go--Charles, Mary, Anne, Henrietta, Louisa, and Captain Wentworth., Ah!, These valuable pictures of yours, Sir Walter, if you chose to leave them, would be perfectly safe., She could not endure that such a friendship as theirs should be severed unfairly., I have known a good deal of the profession; and besides their liberality, they are so neat and careful in all their ways!, he is black at heart, hollow and black!\", So far went his understanding; and his vanity supplied a little additional soothing, in the Admiral's situation in life, which was just high enough, and not too high., The conclusion of the whole was, that if the woman who had been sensible of Captain Wentworth's merits could be allowed to prefer another man, there was nothing in the engagement to excite lasting wonder; and if Captain Wentworth lost no friend by it, certainly nothing to be regretted., Nay, most likely they are married already, for I do not know what they should wait for.\", Captain Benwick had been seen flying by their house, with a countenance which showed something to be wrong; and they had set off immediately, informed and directed as they passed, towards the spot., Lucky fellow to get anything so soon, with no more interest than his., \"He will sit poring over his book, and not know when a person speaks to him, or when one drop's one's scissors, or anything that happens., The estate at Winthrop is not less than two hundred and fifty acres, besides the farm near Taunton, which is some of the best land in the country., She could only compare Mr Elliot to Lady Russell, in the wish of really comprehending what had passed, and in the degree of concern for what she must have suffered in witnessing it., \"Very good humoured, unaffected girls, indeed,\" said Mrs Croft, in a tone of calmer praise, such as made Anne suspect that her keener powers might not consider either of them as quite worthy of her brother; \"and a very respectable family., Once she felt that he was looking at herself, observing her altered features, perhaps, trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once charmed him; and once she knew that he must have spoken of her; she was hardly aware of it, till she heard the answer;, If Mrs Clay were a very beautiful woman, I grant you, it might be wrong to have her so much with me; not that anything in the world, I am sure, would induce my father to make a degrading match, but he might be rendered unhappy., Mary deplored the necessity for herself., \", after Mr and Mrs Musgrove's going than Anne conceived they could have been at all wanted, they were yet the first of the family to be at home again; and as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross they drove over to the Lodge., \"Well,\" said Anne, \"I certainly am proud, too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place.\", I am not more alarmed about little Charles now than he is., \", Nothing ever happened on either side that was not announced immediately., I have been thinking whether you had not better remain in the carriage with her, while I go in and break it to Mr and Mrs Musgrove., Charles, Henrietta, and Captain Wentworth were the three in consultation, and for a little while it was only an interchange of perplexity and terror., He had been engaged to Captain Harville's sister, and was now mourning her loss., His chance for the Kellynch estate was something, but all the honour of the family he held as cheap as dirt., I will not abuse him., Oh God!, The Miss Musgrove, that all this has been happening to., He began by speaking of the concert gravely, more like the Captain Wentworth of Uppercross; owned himself disappointed, had expected singing; and in short, must confess that he should not be sorry when it was over., That evening seemed to be made up of exquisite moments., They got on fast., In the mean while she was in the carriage., `In the name of heaven, who is that old fellow?', I am every instant hearing something which overpowers me., There must be the same immediate association of thought, though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain., \"I cannot imagine why they should suppose I should not like a long walk,\" said Mary, as she went up stairs., and I desire you will never insult me with my second W. again, meaning, for the rest of my life, to be only yours truly,--Wm., Pray say so, with my compliments., When you come to a frigate, of course, you are more confined; though any reasonable woman may be perfectly happy in one of them; and I can safely say, that the happiest part of my life has been spent on board a ship., You are extremely troublesome., Now Mary, I declare it was so,, for it seems to amuse her more than the piano-forte., Their house was undoubtedly the best in Camden Place; their drawing-rooms had many decided advantages over all the others which they had either seen or heard of, and the superiority was not less in the style of the fitting-up, or the taste of the furniture., He persisted in having loved none but her., Anne felt an instant oppression, and wherever she looked saw symptoms of the same., \"I know you did; I know it all perfectly, but--\" \"Indeed, Mrs Smith, we must not expect to get real information in such a line., After a short pause, Mr Shepherd presumed to say--, , as there was no reason to suppose it perpetuated by offspring, have been got over, had he not done worse; but he had, as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends, they had been informed, spoken most disrespectfully of them all, most slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he belonged to, and the honours which were hereafter to be his own., The waiter came into the room soon afterwards., This was very wonderful if it were true; and Lady Russell was in a state of very agreeable curiosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot, already recanting the sentiment she had so lately expressed to Mary, of his being \"a man whom she had no wish to see., Charles and Mary also came in, of course, during their visit, and Mr Musgrove made a point of paying his respects to Lady Russell, and sat down close to her for ten minutes, talking with a very raised voice, but from the clamour of the children on his knees, generally in vain., She could now answer as she ought; and was happy to feel, when Mrs Croft's next words explained it to be Mr Wentworth of whom she spoke, that she had said nothing which might not do for either brother., Of course,\" said Mary, \"you will mention our seeing Mr Elliot, the next time you write to Bath., \"That is precisely what I was going to observe,\" cried Mrs Croft., He had always been lucky; he knew he should be so still., I cannot produce written proof again, but I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire, of what he is now wanting, and what he is now doing., Her spirits wanted the solitude and silence which only numbers could give., \" How was Anne to set all these matters to rights?, The peace turned him on shore at the very moment, and he has been living with us, in our little family circle, ever since.\", Mrs Clay, who had been present while all this passed, now thought it advisable to leave the room, and Anne could have said much, and did long to say a little in defence of her friend's not very dissimilar claims to theirs, but her sense of personal respect to her father prevented her., But here you are in Bath, and the object is to be established here with all the credit and dignity which ought to belong to Sir Walter Elliot., Their preparations, however, were stopped short., Their evil was incalculable., A moment's reflection shewed her the mistake she had been under., He was full of `to-morrow,' and it is very evident that I have been full of it too, ever since I entered the house, and learnt the extension of your plan and all that had happened, or my seeing him could never have gone so entirely out of my head.\", There is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd, and this you had., Everything in and about the house would be taken such excellent care of!, A morning of thorough confusion was to be expected., That Louisa must remain where she was, however distressing to her friends to be involving the Harvilles in such trouble, did not admit a doubt., Charles was to return to Lyme the same afternoon, and his father had at first half a mind to go with him, but the ladies could not consent., But since he must be absent some time or other, I do not perceive how he can ever be secure while she holds her present influence., ; the change of Mary for Anne was inevitable., what can you possibly have to do?\", \" Anne could listen no longer; she could not even have told how the poor Admiral's complexion escaped; her letter engrossed her., Captain Wentworth was acknowledged again by each, by Elizabeth more graciously than before., Lady Russell could not hear the door-bell without feeling that it might be his herald; nor could Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her father's grounds, or any visit of charity in the village, without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him., I have been doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you., as if he saw a place on it well worth occupying; when at that moment a touch on her shoulder obliged Anne to turn round., the pretty features which he had by no means forgotten, and instantly saw, with amusement at his little start of surprise, that he had not been at all aware of who she was., She must learn to feel that she had been mistaken with regard to both; that she had been unfairly influenced by appearances in each; that because Captain Wentworth's manners had not suited her own ideas, she had been too quick in suspecting them to indicate a character of dangerous impetuosity; and that because Mr Elliot's manners had precisely pleased her in their propriety and correctness, their general politeness and suavity, she had been too quick in receiving them as the certain result of the most correct opinions and well-regulated mind., he was gone down to Edward's, and there he has been ever since., Lady Russell had only to listen composedly, and wish them happy, but internally her heart revelled in angry pleasure, in pleased contempt, that the man who at twenty-three had seemed to understand somewhat of the value of an Anne Elliot, should, eight years afterwards, be charmed by a Louisa Musgrove., Tunbridge Wells,\" and dated from London, as far back as July, 1803:, Anne sometimes fancied she discerned him at a distance, but he never came., She was particularly asked to meet Mr Elliot, and be introduced to Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, who were fortunately already engaged to come; and she could not have received a more gratifying attention., The listener's proverbial fate was not absolutely hers; she had heard no evil of herself, but she had heard a great deal of very painful import., Quite worn out and broken up., I perfectly see how the hours passed: that you had always something agreeable to listen to., He undertakes it;\" (looking towards Captain Wentworth,) \"he is writing about it now.\", \"I should be extremely happy; I hope you cannot doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you,\" replied Anne; \"but I suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot, a greater right to influence him, than is really the case., She thought it could scarcely escape him to feel that a persuadable temper might sometimes be as much in favour of happiness as a very resolute character., It was driven by a servant in mourning., Each behaving so pleasantly., \"Only give me a hearing., I shall certainly go; I am sure I ought, But in this case, Anne had left nothing for advice to do; and though Lady Russell, as satisfied as ever with her own discretion, never wished the past undone, she began now to have the anxiety which borders on hopelessness for Anne's being tempted, by some man of talents and independence, to enter a state for which she held her to be peculiarly fitted by her warm affections and domestic habits., It did not appear to him that Sir Walter could materially alter his style of living in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient dignity to support., We each begin, probably, with a little bias towards our own sex; and upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has occurred within our own circle; many of which circumstances (perhaps those very cases which strike us the most) may be precisely such as cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence, or in some respect saying what should not be said., But then, it had been taken up by his father and mother., Her answers to the kindness and the remarks of her companions were at first unconsciously given., \"You are a good soul,\" cried Captain Harville, putting his hand on her arm, quite affectionately., The revolution which one instant had made in Anne, was almost beyond expression., Had you?\" cried he, catching the same tone; \"I honour you!\", His spirits had been greatly recovering lately as might be expected., He longed to see her., Was it not enough to make the fool of me which I appeared?, A sick child is always the mother's property: her own feelings generally make it so.\", said--, They were of sobering tendency; they allayed agitation; they composed, and consequently must make her happier., Alarming sounds were heard; other visitors approached, and the door was thrown open for Sir Walter and Miss Elliot, whose entrance seemed to give a general chill., Such opposition, as these feelings produced, was more than Anne could combat., He had, in fact, though his sisters were now doing all they could for him, by calling him \"poor Richard,\" been nothing better than a thick-headed, unfeeling, unprofitable Dick Musgrove, who had never done anything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his name, living or dead., Louisa certainly put more forward for his notice than her sister., \"he has not, perhaps, a more sorrowing heart than I have., \"Oh! no, that must have been quite accidental., He is so very strict and scrupulous in his notions; over-scrupulous I must say., I always look upon her as able to persuade a person to anything!, With the exception, perhaps, of Admiral and Mrs Croft, who seemed particularly attached and happy, (Anne could allow no other exceptions even among the married couples), there could have been no two hearts so open, no tastes so similar, no feelings so in unison, no countenances so beloved., I know you will not be sorry to be off., She found, on reaching home, that she had, as she intended, escaped seeing Mr Elliot; that he had called and paid them a long morning visit; but hardly had she congratulated herself, and felt safe, when she heard that he was coming again in the evening., \"I cannot possibly do without Anne,\" was Mary's reasoning; and Elizabeth's reply was, \"Then I am sure Anne had better stay, for nobody will want her in Bath.\", But to be waiting so long in inaction, and waiting only for evil, had been dreadful., I lay no embargo on any body's words., Captain Wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which shewed his noticing of it., Having long had as much money as he could spend, nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence, he has been gradually learning to pin his happiness upon the consequence he is heir to., But I never went beyond the Streights, and never was in the West Indies., \"I would rather have young people settle on a small income at once, and have to struggle with a few difficulties together, than be involved in a long engagement., I have a great curiosity to know what Mr Elliot was as a very young man., I had not recollected it before, ; he would not dine from home, but he might walk in for half an hour., \"Wentworth?, \", He almost wished she had been prevailed on to come home the day before; but the truth was, that Mrs Harville left nothing for anybody to do.\", And, upon my word, he is nothing to me., Anne, must not it be our Mr Elliot?, She exclaimed, however, with a very tolerable imitation of nature: -- \", The heir presumptive, the very William Walter Elliot, Esq., whose rights had been so generously supported by her father, had disappointed her., `How d'ye do?', We have seen nothing of him since November., This was handsome, and gave her more pleasure than almost anything else could have done., \"And mine,\" added Sir Walter., I was really in pain for him; for your hard-hearted sister, Miss Anne, seems bent on cruelty.\", The belief of being prudent, and self-denying, principally for his advantage, was her chief consolation, under the misery of a parting, a final parting; and every consolation was required, for she had to encounter all the additional pain of opinions, on his side, totally unconvinced and unbending, and of his feeling himself ill used by so forced a relinquishment., In any other place Sir Walter might judge for himself; and would be looked up to, as regulating the modes of life in whatever way he might choose to model his household.\", \"My feelings, you see, did not prevent my taking Mrs Harville and all her family to Plymouth.\", But poor Mrs Clay who, with all her merits, can never have been reckoned tolerably pretty, I really think poor Mrs Clay may be staying here in perfect safety., He had always a home with us whenever he chose it; he was always welcome; he was like a brother., Though neither Henrietta, nor Louisa, nor Charles Hayter, nor Captain Wentworth were there, the room presented as strong a contrast as could be wished to the last state she had seen it in., But first of all, you must tell me the name of the young lady I am going to talk about., The change was indubitable., He was courting her week after week., Mr and Mrs Musgrove, either from seeing little, or from an entire confidence in the discretion of both their daughters, and of all the young men who came near them, seemed to leave everything to take its chance., \", Mr Elliot appeared to think that he (Sir Walter) was looking exactly as he had done when they last parted;\" but Sir Walter had \"not been able to return the compliment entirely, which had embarrassed him., Elizabeth had turned from him, Lady Russell overlooked him; her nerves were strengthened by these circumstances; she felt that she owed him attention., As to the wretched party left behind, it could scarcely be said which of the three, who were completely rational, was suffering most:, We were principally in town, living in very good style., \", \"It was my friend Mrs Rooke; Nurse Rooke;, No, it was too unkind., I hope I can allow for him., \"We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft's here soon; I dare say you know him by name.\", when Mrs Clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention, in an enquiry after Mrs Charles Musgrove, and her fine little boys, Anne was at liberty., Next week?, If Jemima were not the trustiest, steadiest creature in the world, it would be enough to spoil her; for she tells me, they are always tempting her to take a walk with them.\", A small house in their own neighbourhood, where they might still have Lady Russell's society, still be near Mary, and still have the pleasure of sometimes seeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch, was the object of her ambition., With a confidence in Mr Elliot's regard, more creditable to his feelings than his judgement, Mr Smith had appointed him the executor of his will; but Mr Elliot would not act, and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her, in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her situation, had been such as could not be related without anguish of spirit, or listened to without corresponding indignation., How absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an interval had banished into distance and indistinctness!, Mrs Harville's giving it as her opinion that her husband would have quite walking enough by the time he reached home, determined the direction of all the party in what was to be their last walk; they would accompany them to their door, and then return and set off themselves., `Elegance, sweetness, beauty.', So, I give you notice, Lady Russell.\", Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did, nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society., I am quite of your opinion, Mrs Croft,\" was Mrs Musgrove's hearty answer., \", ; I speak, you know, of the higher rates., \" When they were got a little farther, Anne ventured to press again for what he had to communicate., She was persuaded that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home, and every anxiety attending his profession, all their probable fears, delays, and disappointments, she should yet have been a happier woman in maintaining the engagement, than she had been in the sacrifice of it; and this, she fully believed, had the usual share, had even more than the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs, without reference to the actual results of their case, which, as it happened, would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be reasonably calculated on., he did not; he seemed in no hurry to leave her; and presently with renewed spirit, with a little smile, a little glow, That's the worst of him.\", \" This was the principle on which Anne wanted her father to be proceeding, his friends to be urging him., Not know Mr Elliot, indeed!, But what a thing here is, by way of a boat!, Good God!\", He drew, he varnished, he carpentered, he glued; he made toys for the children; he fashioned new netting-needles and pins with improvements; and if everything else was done, sat down to his large fishing-net at one corner of the room., I found them most intimate friends; and I, too, became excessively pleased with Mr Elliot, and entertained the highest opinion of him., she consulted Anne, who never seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the question., They had not a fault to find in him., Though I have forgot the exact terms, I have a perfect impression of the general meaning., There she had listened to Henrietta's schemes for Dr Shirley's leaving Uppercross; farther on, she had first seen Mr Elliot; a moment seemed all that could now be given to any one but Louisa, or those who were wrapt up in her welfare., \", So we must be as merry as we can, that she may not be dwelling upon such gloomy things., No, these were noises which belonged to the winter pleasures; her spirits rose under their influence; and like Mrs Musgrove, she was feeling, though not saying, that after being long in the country, nothing could be so good for her as a little quiet cheerfulness., It was evident that Charles Hayter was not well inclined towards Captain Wentworth., There was no injury but to the head., You pierce my soul., By remaining in the neighbourhood, I am become inured to it., There was so much of friendliness, and of flattery, and of everything most bewitching in his reception there; the old were so hospitable, the young so agreeable, that he could not but resolve to remain where he was, and take all the charms and perfections of Edward's wife upon credit a little longer., a Mr (save, perhaps, some half dozen in the nation,) always needs a note of explanation., Various as were the tempers in her father's house, he pleased them all., They will be delighted to come to-morrow evening., And I do assure you, ma'am,\" pursued Mrs Croft, \"that nothing can exceed the accommodations of a man-of-war, Louisa returned; and Mary, finding a comfortable seat for herself on the step of a stile, was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood about her; but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away, to try for a gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge-row, and they were gone by degrees quite out of sight and sound, Mary was happy no longer; she quarrelled with her own seat, was sure Louisa had got a much better somewhere, and nothing could prevent her from going to look for a better also., It is something for a woman to be assured, in her eight-and-twentieth year, that she has not lost one charm of earlier youth; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased to Anne, by comparing it with former words, and feeling it to be the result, not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment., It must have been about the same time that he became known to my father and sister., \"He had been introduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I was acquainted with him, but I heard him speak of them for ever., \", \"Oh! yes,--I am quite convinced that, with very few exceptions, the sea-air always does good., \", We do not like our lodgings here, The hardness of the pavement for her feet, made him less willing upon the present occasion; he did it, however., I have not nerves for the sort of thing.\", A Mrs Smith., \", Anne was startled and confused; but after standing in a moment's suspense, was obliged, and not sorry to be obliged, to hurry away., She could imagine what Louisa was feeling., \"If I thought it would not tempt her to go out in sharp winds, and grow coarse, I would send her a new hat and pelisse., \" She had a great wish to see him., The two families were so continually meeting, so much in the habit of running in and out of each other's house at all hours, that it was rather a surprise to her to find Mary alone; but being alone, her being unwell and out of spirits was almost a matter of course., with all her reasoning, she found, that to retentive feelings eight years may be little more than nothing., Anne had been too little from home, too little seen., It was misery to think of Mr Elliot's attentions., She saw in it but an aggravation of the evil., And so, ma'am, all these thing considered,\" said Mrs Musgrove, in her powerful whisper, \"though we could have wished it different, yet, altogether, we did not think it fair to stand out any longer, for Charles Hayter was quite wild about it, and Henrietta was pretty near as bad; and so we thought they had better marry at once, and make the best of it, as many others have done before them., \" They were not much interested in anything relative to Anne; but still there were questions enough asked, to make it understood what this old schoolfellow was; and Elizabeth was disdainful, and Sir Walter severe. \", \"Upon my word,\" said she, \"I should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted of such difference of conjecture, steady and matter of fact as I may call myself., \"As to all that,\" rejoined Sir Walter coolly, \"supposing I were induced to let my house, Mary had had her evils; but upon the whole, as was evident by her staying so long, she had found more to enjoy than to suffer., And so then, I suppose,\" said Mrs Musgrove, in a low voice, as if thinking aloud, \"so then he went away to the Laconia, and there he met with our poor boy., Depend upon it, whatever esteem Mr Elliot may have for his own situation in life now, as a young man he had not the smallest value for it., He was at that time a very young man, just engaged in the study of the law; and Elizabeth found him extremely agreeable, and every plan in his favour was confirmed., \"The worst is over!\", \"Well, and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl, and what were we to wait for besides?, The absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then an immediate struggle; but after a while she could do no more., He told me the whole story., every comfort of life knocked off!, Ah!, As the head of the house, he felt that he ought to have been consulted, especially after taking the young man so publicly by the hand; \"For they must have been seen together,\" he observed, \"once at Tattersall's, and twice in the lobby of the House of Commons.\", The sea is no beautifier, certainly; sailors do grow old betimes; I have observed it; they soon lose the look of youth., Here are pretty girls enough, I am sure., A most suitable connection everybody must consider it,, She might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy, and yet be happy., One likes to hear what is going on, to be au fait as to the newest modes of being trifling and silly., \" She was now lying on the faded sofa of the pretty little drawing-room, the once elegant furniture of which had been gradually growing shabby, under the influence of four summers and two children; and, on Anne's appearing, greeted her with-- \", With a great deal of quiet observation, and a knowledge, which she often wished less, of her father's character, she was sensible that results the most serious to his family from the intimacy were more than possible., \"But, Captain Wentworth,\" cried Louisa, \"how vexed you must have been when you came to the Asp, to see what an old thing they had given you.\", It is Mr Elliot himself.\", Money, money, was all that he wanted., If he does, however, they will leave me in peace, which may be a decent equivalent for the reversion., \"About a fortnight., Their dress had every advantage, their faces were rather pretty, their spirits extremely good, their manner unembarrassed and pleasant; they were of consequence at home, and favourites abroad., --Women may be as comfortable on board, as in the best house in England., Then it is settled, Musgrove,\" cried Captain Wentworth, \"that you stay, and that I take care of your sister home., A few years before, Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl, but her bloom had vanished early; and as even in its height, He was shy, and disposed to abstraction; but the engaging mildness of her countenance, and gentleness of her manners, soon had their effect; and Anne was well repaid the first trouble of exertion., The usual character of them has nothing for me., Anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing; but the age of emotion she certainly had not., \"Walter,\" cried Charles Hayter, \"why do you not do as you are bid?, \", But Charles is so positive!, I am no card-player.\", that it became a matter of course the next morning, still to defer her explanatory visit in Rivers Street., Her eyes were bright and her cheeks glowed; but she knew nothing about it., Here is a nut,\" said he, catching one down from an upper bough. \", \", Well, my dear Penelope, you need not be so alarmed about him., oh Lord!, It was just possible that she might have been persuaded by Lady Russell!, She saw that he saw Elizabeth, that Elizabeth saw him, that there was complete internal recognition on each side; she was convinced that he was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance, expecting it, and she had the pain of seeing her sister turn away with unalterable coldness., Had she not imagined herself consulting his good, even more than her own, she could hardly have given him up., He had, probably, never heard, and never thought of any claims of Charles Hayter., He found too late, in short, that he had entangled himself; and that precisely as he became fully satisfied of his not caring for Louisa at all, he must regard himself as bound to her, if her sentiments for him were what the Harvilles supposed., she, in receiving his declarations and proposals, or he in having them accepted., I should not have supposed that you could have found anything in Lyme to inspire such a feeling., She must talk to Lady Russell, tell her, consult with her, and having done her best, wait the event with as much composure as possible; and after all, her greatest want of composure would be in that quarter of the mind which could not be opened to Lady Russell; in that flow of anxieties and fears which must be all to herself., The charm of Kellynch and of \"Lady Elliot\" all faded away., It is Anne's own proposal, and so I shall go with you, which will be a great deal better, for I have not dined at the other house since Tuesday.\", Lucky fellow to get her!, Anne was conscious of not doing it so well as Lady Russell., Captain Benwick must give up his room to them, and get another bed elsewhere; and the whole was settled., \"Oh!, Lord Byron's \"dark blue seas\" could not fail of being brought forward by their present view, and she gladly gave him all her attention as long as attention was possible., In such moments Anne had no power of saying to herself, \"These rooms ought to belong only to us., \"Oh! if these are your only objections,\" cried Mrs Smith, archly, \"Mr Elliot is safe, and I shall give myself no more trouble about him., The gentlemen had their own pursuits, the ladies proceeded on their own business, and they met no more while Anne belonged to them., They were not off the Cobb, before the Harvilles met them., Mrs Smith made no reply; but when she was leaving her said, and with an expression half serious, half arch, \"Well, I heartily wish your concert may answer; and do not fail me to-morrow if you can come; for I begin to have a foreboding that I may not have many more visits from you., \"I have let my house to Admiral Croft,\" would sound extremely well; very much better than to any mere Mr--;, No, no; Frederick is not a man to whine and complain; he has too much spirit for that., Happily for her, they were not many., Man is more robust than woman, but he is not longer lived; which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments., The Crofts had placed themselves in lodgings in Gay Street, perfectly to Sir Walter's satisfaction., Do not you think it is quite a mistaken point of conscience, when a clergyman sacrifices his health for the sake of duties, which may be just as well performed by another person?, Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth!, He had no sooner been free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of Louisa's accident, no sooner begun to feel himself alive again, than he had begun to feel himself, though alive, not at liberty., She had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere, but now she saw insincerity in everything., He joined them; but, as if irresolute whether to join or to pass on, said nothing, only looked., A poor widow barely able to live, between thirty and forty; a mere Mrs Smith, an every-day Mrs Smith, of all people and all names in the world, to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot, and to be preferred by her to her own family connections among the nobility of England and Ireland!, \"Yes, yes, I see you are., As Louisa improved, he had improved, and he was now quite a different creature from what he had been the first week., She turned through the same gate, but could not see them., In all other respects, her visit began and proceeded very well., , she was well able to watch for a likeness, and if it failed her in the features, to catch it in the voice, or in the turn of sentiment and expression., Mrs Musgrove told me I should find them here,\" before he walked to the window to recollect himself, and feel how he ought to behave., But, though discomfited and disappointed, he could still do something for his own interest and his own enjoyment., And at Lyme too, only seventeen miles off, he would be near enough to hear, if people thought there was anything to complain of.\", It would be but a new creation, however, and I never think much of your new creations., Get up and go over all the rooms in the house if you like it.\", this is too much flattery., Louisa's voice was the first distinguished., Chapter 15 Sir Walter had taken a very good house in Camden Place, a lofty dignified situation, such as becomes a man of consequence; and both he and Elizabeth were settled there, much to their satisfaction., When he questioned, Sir Walter and Elizabeth began to question also, but the difference in their manner of doing it could not be unfelt., \", Unjust I may have been, weak and resentful, I wish he may be induced to call here., Upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in, they kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired; it would save her a full mile, and they were going through Uppercross., Lady Russell could not help laughing., Tell me if, when I returned to England in the year eight, with a few thousand pounds, and was posted into the Laconia, if I had then written to you, would you have answered my letter?, but one opinion of Captain Wentworth among the Musgroves and their dependencies., \"No,\" cried Anne, quickly, \"it cannot be Mr Elliot, I assure you., , I have no scruple at all., Charles, in the meanwhile, was very decidedly declaring his resolution of calling on his aunt, now that he was so near; and very evidently, though more fearfully, trying to induce his wife to go too., \"It first came into my head,\" replied Mrs Smith, \"upon finding how much you were together, and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you; and you may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in the same way., \" But in this he was eagerly opposed by his wife, with \"Oh!, I am half agony, half hope., The idea of becoming what her mother had been; of having the precious name of \"Lady Elliot\" first revived in herself; of being restored to Kellynch, calling it her home again, her home for ever, was a charm which she could not immediately resist., The baronet, nevertheless, is not unlikely to marry again; he is quite fool enough., Anne avoided a direct reply, but it was just the circumstance which she considered as not merely unnecessary to be communicated, but as what ought to be suppressed., Shabby fellows, both of them!, I am only ready whenever you are., He was to leave Bath at nine this morning, and does not come back till to-morrow.\", She learned that (the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by Mr Elliot's marriage) they had been as before always together, and Mr Elliot had led his friend into expenses much beyond his fortune., we shall certainly take that post.\", \" Vanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot's character; vanity of person and of situation., She was of strict integrity herself, with a delicate sense of honour; but she was as desirous of saving Sir Walter's feelings, as solicitous for the credit of the family, as aristocratic in her ideas of what was due to them, as anybody of sense and honesty could well be., If I would not go for the sake of your father, I should think it scandalous to go for the sake of his heir., She now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door; she wanted to see if it rained., I have not had a creature call on me since the second week in January, except Charles Hayter, who had been calling much oftener than was welcome., \"Are you serious?\", Miss Carteret was very anxious to have a general idea of what was next to be sung., She generally thought he would come, because she generally thought he ought; but it was a case which she could not so shape into any positive act of duty or discretion, as inevitably to defy the suggestions of very opposite feelings., cried Mary; \"it must be our cousin; it must be our Mr Elliot, it must, indeed!, \"If you had been a week later at Lisbon, last spring, Frederick, you would have been asked to give a passage to Lady Mary Grierson and her daughters.\", Six years of separation and suffering might have been spared., A bed on the floor in Louisa's room would be sufficient for her, if Mrs Harville would but think so., You are safe in all worldly matters, and safe in his character., She coloured deeply, and he recollected himself and moved away., She could not help thinking much of the extraordinary circumstances attending their acquaintance, of the right which he seemed to have to interest her, by everything in situation, by his own sentiments, by his early prepossession., We are always meeting with some old friend or other; the streets full of them every morning; sure to have plenty of chat; and then we get away from them all, and shut ourselves in our lodgings, and draw in our chairs, and are snug as if we were at Kellynch, ay, or as we used to be even at North Yarmouth and Deal., Where could have been the attraction?, I am in very good anchorage here,\" (smiling at Anne,) \"well supplied, and want for nothing., , she determined to mention it, and it seemed to her there was guilt in Mrs Clay's face as she listened., There was a family of cousins within a walk of Uppercross, in less affluent circumstances, who depended on the Musgroves for all their pleasures: they would come at any time, and help play at anything, or dance anywhere; and Anne, very much preferring the office of musician to a more active post, played country dances to them by the hour together; a kindness which always recommended her musical powers to the notice of Mr and Mrs Musgrove more than anything else, and often drew this compliment;--, \" When she could command Mary's attention, Anne quietly tried to convince her that their father and Mr Elliot had not, for many years, been on such terms as to make the power of attempting an introduction at all desirable., very true., She had had a disappointment, moreover, which that book, and especially the history of her own family, must ever present the remembrance of., \" She checked herself just in time., Charles heard it quite by chance; they have not had the civility to give me any notice, or of offering to take anything., Too good, too excellent creature!, What should a young fellow like you do ashore for half a year together?, \"Ay, true enough,\" (with a deep sigh) \"only June.\" \"And not known to him, perhaps, so soon.\" \"Not till the first week of August, when he came home from the Cape, just made into the Grappler., It had not been possible for him to spend less; he had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot was imperiously called on to do; but blameless as he was, he was not only growing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often, that it became vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially, from his daughter., It would be a pity to be divided, and we should be losing Miss Anne, too, if there is a party at her father's; and I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play, if Miss Anne could not be with us.\", What!, She who had not been able to remain in Louisa's room, or to look at her, without sufferings which made her worse than helpless!, \"Very true, very true., Anne, finding she might decline it, did so, very gratefully., Breakfast had not been long over, when they were joined by Captain and Mrs Harville and Captain Benwick; with whom they had appointed to take their last walk about Lyme., His disapprobation was expressed, but apparently very little regarded., She knew herself to be of the first utility to the child; and what was it to her if Frederick Wentworth were only half a mile distant, making himself agreeable to others?, Little Charles does not mind a word I say, and Walter is growing quite as bad.\", Frederick Wentworth had used such words, or something like them, but without an idea that they would be carried round to her., I have not seen one of them to-day, except Mr Musgrove, who just stopped and spoke through the window, but without getting off his horse; and though I told him how ill I was, not one of them have been near me., Mrs Musgrove had little arrangements of her own at her own table; to their protection she must trust, and sinking into the chair which he had occupied, succeeding to the very spot where he had leaned and written, her eyes devoured the following words: \"I can listen no longer in silence., How she might have felt had there been no Captain Wentworth in the case, was not worth enquiry; for there was a Captain Wentworth; and be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad, her affection would be his for ever., Neither more nor less than his being in love with Louisa, and not choosing to venture to Uppercross till he had had an answer from Mr Musgrove; for it was all settled between him and her before she came away, and he had written to her father by Captain Harville., In one point, her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of Mr Elliot., \", Their two confidential friends, Mr Shepherd, who lived in the neighbouring market town, and Lady Russell, were called to advise them; and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and reduce their expenditure, without involving the loss of any indulgence of taste or pride., Mrs Musgrove had not a word to say in dissent; she could not accuse herself of having ever called them anything in the whole course of her life. \", One thing more, and all seemed arranged., How sure to be mistaken!, \"Pray,\" said Mrs Smith, \"is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with me?, how can you think of such a thing?, The same image of Mr Elliot speaking for himself brought Anne to composure again., Colonel Wallis had been so impatient to be introduced to them!, It was a great object to her to escape all enquiry or eclat; but it was her intention to be as decidedly cool to him as might be compatible with their relationship; and to retrace, as quietly as she could, the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she had been gradually led along., Jemima is so careful; and she could send us word every hour how he was., She hoped, on turning her head, to see the master of the house; but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters easy--Charles Hayter, probably not at all better pleased by the sight of Captain Wentworth than Captain Wentworth had been by the sight of Anne., how very odd!, With all my soul I wish them happy, and rejoice over every circumstance in favour of it., He must be either indifferent or unwilling., \"But what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance?\" asked Elizabeth., Chapter 3, There could be no doubt of his being a sensible man., Nobody could do it, but that good fellow\", Will it not be wiser to accept the society of those good ladies in Laura Place, and enjoy all the advantages of the connexion as far as possible?, \" Many had looked on each other, and many had repeated the name, before all this had been got through, even by the smart rapidity of a waiter., Miss Elliot, I am sure you are tired,\" cried Mrs Croft., Lord bless me!, There were more completely popular., Captain Harville holds himself quite engaged, I'll answer for it; and Captain Wentworth the same, \"That is the woman I want,\" said he., , I wonder the arms did not strike me!, Should not this be enough for a sailor, who has had no society among women to make him nice?\", I believe you equal to every important exertion, and to every domestic forbearance, so long as--if I may be allowed the expression--so long as you have an object., Mr Elliot, and his friends in Marlborough Buildings, were talked of the whole evening. \", You remember him, I am sure.\", The lawyer plods, quite care-worn; the physician is up at all hours, and travelling in all weather; and even the clergyman--\" she stopt a moment to consider what might do for the clergyman;--\"and even the clergyman, you know is obliged to go into infected rooms, and expose his health and looks to all the injury of a poisonous atmosphere., \"Where shall we go?\", There was only a small part of his estate that Sir Walter could dispose of; but had every acre been alienable, it would have made no difference., \"Something a little inferior I shall of course put up with, but it must not be much., Unintentionally she returned to that part of the room; he saw her, and, instantly rising, said, with studied politeness--, Something so formal and arrange in her air!, I could not comprehend how., Does he know that I am in Bath?\", Lady Russell and Anne paid their compliments to them once, when Anne could not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again., A large bulky figure has as good a right to be in deep affliction, as the most graceful set of limbs in the world., However, when I found how excessively he was regretting that he should miss my father this morning, I gave way immediately, for I would never really omit an opportunity of bring him and Sir Walter together., They were come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove, and were at the White Hart., He looked completely astonished, but not more astonished than pleased; his eyes brightened!, I thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased, but it is now a confirmed feeling., When I have made up my mind, I have made it; and Henrietta seemed entirely to have made up hers to call at Winthrop to-day; and yet, she was as near giving it up, out of nonsensical complaisance!\", But it was not a merely selfish caution, under which she acted, in putting an end to it., He had been several years at sea, and had, in the course of those removals to which all midshipmen are liable, and especially such midshipmen as every captain wishes to get rid of, been six months on board Captain Frederick Wentworth's frigate, the Laconia; and from the Laconia he had, under the influence of his captain, written the only two letters which his father and mother had ever received from him during the whole of his absence; that is to say, the only two disinterested letters; all the rest had been mere applications for money., In all these cases, there are established usages which make everything plain and easy between landlord and tenant., She would certainly have risen to their blessings if she could, but she did not want to lessen theirs., He had called in Camden Place; had called a second time, a third; had been pointedly attentive., She roused herself and went to him., I shall forget my own name soon, I suppose., \"I wish,\" said Henrietta, very well pleased with her companion, \"I wish Lady Russell lived at Uppercross, and were intimate with Dr Shirley., \"But how shall we prove anything?\", and though his voice did not falter, and though she had no reason to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke, Anne felt the utter impossibility, from her knowledge of his mind, that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself., I regard Louisa Musgrove as a very amiable, sweet-tempered girl, and not deficient in understanding, but Benwick is something more., Ah!\" cried Captain Wentworth, instantly, and with half a glance at Anne, \"it is the very man we passed., Anne was ashamed., But the usual fate of Anne attended her, in having something very opposite from her inclination fixed on., as the sisters in the Cottage were sitting quietly at work, they were visited at the window by the sisters from the Mansion-house., quite so direct a line as that, Eight years, almost eight years had passed, since all had been given up., She, however, was soon persuaded to think differently., The Admiral does not seem very ill, and I sincerely hope Bath will do him all the good he wants., Sir Walter had at first thought more of London; but Mr Shepherd felt that he could not be trusted in London, and had been skilful enough to dissuade him from it, and make Bath preferred., The advantage of his having to come only to Uppercross, instead of going six miles another way; of his having, in every respect, a better curacy; of his belonging to their dear Dr Shirley, and of dear, good Dr Shirley's being relieved from the duty which he could no longer get through without most injurious fatigue, had been a great deal, even to Louisa, but had been almost everything to Henrietta., But hardly were they so settled, when the door opened again, and Captain Wentworth walked in alone., that's a very good thought, very good, indeed., There being nothing to eat, he could only have some play; and as his aunt would not let him tease his sick brother, he began to fasten himself upon her, as she knelt, in such a way that, busy as she was about Charles, she could not shake him off., You must consider me only as Mr Elliot's relation., No man and woman, would, probably., But it was more probable that he should be come to stay., I am not at all equal to it., The surprise of finding himself almost alone with Anne Elliot, deprived his manners of their usual composure: he started, and could only say, \"I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here:, \", how eloquent, at least, were her wishes on the side of early warm attachment, and a cheerful confidence in futurity, against that over-anxious caution which seems to insult exertion and distrust Providence!, he cried, \"you would!, He did not mean to say that there were no pretty women, but the number of the plain was out of all proportion., I wish young ladies had not such a number of fine Christian names., \", She had never been supplanted., In London, perhaps, in your present quiet style of living, it might be as you say: but in Bath; Sir Walter Elliot and his family will always be worth knowing: always acceptable as acquaintance.\", I knew how it would be., But now, the matter has take the strangest turn of all; for this young lady, the same Miss Musgrove, instead of being to marry Frederick, is to marry James Benwick., The others joined them, and it was a group in which Anne found herself also necessarily included., ; that she was perfectly convinced of having had no fall; could part with her cheerfully, and depend on finding her better at night., To be sure, I may just as well go as not, for I am of no use at home--am I?, He is no hypocrite now., Then do tell me what he was at that time of life., \" said he at last., Mary's declaration was, \"I hate sending the children to the Great House, though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them, for she humours and indulges them to such a degree, and gives them so much trash and sweet things, that they are sure to come back sick and cross for the rest of the day.\", Admiral Croft's manners were not quite of the tone to suit Lady Russell, but they delighted Anne., As yet, you have seen nothing of Bath., He begged her pardon, but she must be applied to, to explain Italian again., Chapter 22 Anne went home to think over all that she had heard., the worse, I can tell you, for putting us in mind of those we first had at North Yarmouth., A very few days more, and Captain Wentworth was known to be at Kellynch, and Mr Musgrove had called on him, and come back warm in his praise, and he was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross, by the end of another week., And it is not merely in its follies, that they are well read; for they see it occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or affecting., What Anne first heard was-- \", Heir to Sir Walter Elliot!, and this, without much waiting for an answer; or in the young ladies' addition of, \"I hope we shall be in Bath in the winter; but remember, papa, if we do go, we must be in a good situation: none of your Queen Squares for us!\", how natural, how certain too!, Anne, have you courage to go with me, and pay a visit in that house?, You have always a profession, pursuits, business of some sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately, and continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions.\", When I found he was really going to his friends at Thornberry Park for the whole day to-morrow, I had compassion on him.\", When people come in this manner on purpose to ask us, how can one say no?, Oh! as to being Anne's acquaintance,\" said Mary, \"I think he is rather my acquaintance, for I have been seeing him every day this last fortnight.\", But soon afterwards, rising and pacing the room, he observed sarcastically--, Indeed!, \"This explains it., I knew that we should either go to the bottom together, or that she would be the making of me; and I never had two days of foul weather all the time I was at sea in her; and after taking privateers enough to be very entertaining, I had the good luck in my passage home the next autumn, to fall in with the very French frigate I wanted., I know you love a play; and there is room for us all., He had a heart for either of the Miss Musgroves, if they could catch it; a heart, in short, for any pleasing young woman who came in his way, excepting Anne Elliot., The intervals of sense and consciousness were believed to be stronger., Mary, often a little unwell, and always thinking a great deal of her own complaints, and always in the habit of claiming Anne when anything was the matter, was indisposed; and foreseeing that she should not have a day's health all the autumn, entreated, or rather required her, for it was hardly entreaty, to come to Uppercross Cottage, and bear her company as long as she should want her, instead of going to Bath., It is what I always protested against for my children., He had a wife., She could not stay., Anne was now at hand to take up her own cause, and the sincerity of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him, where conviction was at least very agreeable, he had no farther scruples as to her being left to dine alone, though he still wanted her to join them in the evening, when the child might be at rest for the night, and kindly urged her to let him come and fetch her, but she was quite unpersuadable; and this being the case, \"I should never think of standing on such ceremony with people I know so well as Mrs and the Miss Musgroves.\", Everybody was wanting to visit them., Charles, Anne, must not it?, He gave her a very plain, intelligible account of the whole; a narration in which she saw a great deal of most characteristic proceeding., There was one point which Anne, on returning to her family, would have been more thankful to ascertain even than Mr Elliot's being in love with Elizabeth, which was, her father's not being in love with Mrs Clay; and she was very far from easy about it, when she had been at home a few hours., I was very well yesterday; nothing at all the matter with me till this morning., Though condemning her for the past, and considering it with high and unjust resentment, though perfectly careless of her, and though becoming attached to another, still he could not see her suffer, without the desire of giving her relief., \", Oh!, \"And has it indeed been spoken of?\", There was always such a great connexion between the Dalrymples and ourselves., But this was one of the points on which the lady shewed her strength; and when he recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter of an hour at Winthrop, as she felt so tired, she resolutely answered, \"Oh! no, indeed!, I do not understand it., And such being the case,\" continued Mrs Smith, after a short pause, \"I hope you believe that I do know how to value your kindness in coming to me this morning., They were soon dining in company together at Mr Musgrove's, for the little boy's state could no longer supply his aunt with a pretence for absenting herself; and this was but the beginning of other dinings and other meetings., \"Yes, and you may guess who it is for., He looked at her, looked at Lady Russell, and looking again at her, replied, as if in cool deliberation-- \"Not yet., He gave her to understand that he had looked at her with some earnestness., It would be going only to multiply trouble to the others, and increase his own distress; and a much better scheme followed and was acted upon., They never miss a concert.\", Sir Walter, Elizabeth and Mrs Clay, returned one morning from Laura Place, with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple for the same evening, and Anne was already engaged, to spend that evening in Westgate Buildings., Their union, she believed, could not divide her more from other men, than their final separation., Her accommodations were limited to a noisy parlour, and a dark bedroom behind, with no possibility of moving from one to the other without assistance, which there was only one servant in the house to afford, and she never quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath., She would not have been obstinate if I had not been weak., \", \"No, sir, she is not one-and-thirty; but I do not think I can put off my engagement, because it is the only evening for some time which will at once suit her and myself., I need not ask after her., But now, another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be added to these., I recollect., He had inquired after her, she found, slightly, as might suit a former slight acquaintance, seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged, actuated, perhaps, by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet., Mr Elliot, raised by his marriage to great affluence, and disposed to every gratification of pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself, (for with all his self-indulgence he had become a prudent man), and beginning to be rich, just as his friend ought to have found himself to be poor, seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend's probable finances, but, on the contrary, had been prompting and encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin; and the Smiths accordingly had been ruined., There the news must follow him, but who was to tell it?, And looked back, with fond regret, to the bustles of Uppercross and the seclusion of Kellynch., They ascended and passed him; and as they passed, Anne's face caught his eye, and he looked at her with a degree of earnest admiration, which she could not be insensible of., Dear me!, Is he coming, Louisa?, A few days had made a change indeed!, : carry her gently to the inn.\", \"Well, it would serve to cure him of an absurd practice of never asking a question at an inn, which he had adopted, when quite a young man, on the principal of its being very ungenteel to be curious. \", I only smirked and bowed, and said the word `happy.', Mrs Harville, a degree less polished than her husband, seemed, however, to have the same good feelings; and nothing could be more pleasant than their desire of considering the whole party as friends of their own, because the friends of Captain Wentworth, or more kindly hospitable than their entreaties for their all promising to dine with them., Good company requires only birth, education, and manners, and with regard to education is not very nice., \"Well, you will soon be better now,\" replied Anne, cheerfully., the great-coat was hanging over the panel, and hid the arms, so it did; otherwise, I am sure, I should have observed them, and the livery too; if the servant had not been in mourning, one should have known him by the livery.\", Once she did contrive to push him away, but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her back again directly. \", Since he actually was expected in the country, she must teach herself to be insensible on such points., If I loved a man, as she loves the Admiral, I would always be with him, nothing should ever separate us, and I would rather be overturned by him, than driven safely by anybody else., \" Anne was still in the lane; and though instinctively beginning to decline, she was not allowed to proceed., \"They are up stairs with my sister: they will be down in a few moments, I dare say,\" had been Anne's reply, in all the confusion that was natural; and if the child had not called her to come and do something for him, she would have been out of the room the next moment, and released Captain Wentworth as well as herself., She had never been staying there before, without being struck by it, or without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage in seeing how unknown, or unconsidered there, were the affairs which at Kellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervading interest; yet, with all this experience, she believed she must now submit to feel that another lesson, in the art of knowing our own nothingness beyond our own circle, was become necessary for her;, The two families had always been on excellent terms, there being no pride on one side, and no envy on the other, and only such a consciousness of superiority in the Miss Musgroves, as made them pleased to improve their cousins., He answered rather hesitatingly, \"Yes, I believe I do; very much recovered; but she is altered; there is no running or jumping about, no laughing or dancing; it is quite different., Anne, judging from her own temperament, would have deemed such a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves, which Louisa's illness must have so greatly shaken., If a man had not a wife, he soon wants to be afloat again.\", On the contents of that letter depended all which this world could do for her., Here was a great deal to soften the business., And upon looking over his letters and things, she found it was so, and is perfectly sure that this must be the very man, and her head is quite full of it, and of poor Richard!, She might not wonder, but she must sigh that her father should feel no degradation in his change, should see nothing to regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder, should find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town; and she must sigh, and smile, and wonder too, as Elizabeth threw open the folding-doors and walked with exultation from one drawing-room to the other, boasting of their space; at the possibility of that woman, who had been mistress of Kellynch Hall, finding extent to be proud of between two walls, perhaps thirty feet asunder., Promising to be with them the whole of the following morning, therefore, she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to Camden Place, there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements of Elizabeth and Mrs Clay for the morrow's party, the frequent enumeration of the persons invited, and the continually improving detail of all the embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant of its kind in Bath, while harassing herself with the never-ending question, of whether Captain Wentworth would come or not?, So much novelty and beauty!, I declare I have not a comfort or an indulgence about me, even at Kellynch Hall,\" (with a kind bow to Anne), \"beyond what I always had in most of the ships I have lived in; and they have been five altogether.\", What an immense time Mrs Clay has been staying with Elizabeth!, How quick come the reasons for approving what we like!, \"Upon my word it would,\" replied Mary., He had no concealments with me., Sir Walter, however, would choose his own means, and at last wrote a very fine letter of ample explanation, regret, and entreaty, to his right honourable cousin., I wish I had looked at him more., Do not mistake me, however., For thirteen years had she been doing the honours, and laying down the domestic law at home, and leading the way to the chaise and four, and walking immediately after Lady Russell out of all the drawing-rooms and dining-rooms in the country., I have been several times in the garden with Mackenzie, trying to understand, and make him understand, which of Elizabeth's plants are for Lady Russell., The disgrace of his first marriage might, perhaps, \"Ay, ay, Miss Louisa Musgrove, that is the name., Her pleasure in the walk must arise from the exercise and the day, from the view of the last smiles of the year upon the tawny leaves, and withered hedges, and from repeating to herself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant of autumn, that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind of taste and tenderness, that season which had drawn from every poet, worthy of being read, some attempt at description, or some lines of feeling., I never saw anybody in my life spell harder for an invitation., It might have been an opportunity of watching the loves and jealousies of the four-- they were now altogether; but she could stay for none of it., She had something to suffer, perhaps, when they came into contact again, in seeing Anne restored to the rights of seniority, and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette; but she had a future to look forward to, of powerful consolation., She had sought him., Charles is out shooting., \"You should have distinguished,\" replied Anne., He was not at all ashamed of the acquaintance, and did, in fact, think and talk a great deal more about the Admiral, than the Admiral ever thought or talked about him., These were her internal persuasions: \"Old fashioned notions; country hospitality; we do not profess to give dinners; few people in Bath do; Lady Alicia never does; did not even ask her own sister's family, though they were here a month:, \", It is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof., By all their calculations there was just time for this; but as they drew near the Cobb, there was such a general wish to walk along it once more, all were so inclined, and Louisa soon grew so determined,, Do not you think, Anne, it is being over-scrupulous?, Ah!, Lady Russell, in spite of all her former transgressions, he could now value from his heart., They must retrench; that did not admit of a doubt., They ought to be setting off for Uppercross by one, and in the mean while were to be all together, and out of doors as long as they could., No letter of condolence had been sent to Ireland., She goes into the warm bath to-morrow, and for the rest of the week, you know, we are engaged.\", Pity for him was all over., \"Is not this song worth staying for?\" said Anne, suddenly struck by an idea which made her yet more anxious to be encouraging., \"My dear Mary, recollect what a comfortable account you sent me of yourself!, Now she hoped for some beneficial change; and, after a period of nothing-saying amongst the party, some of them did decide on going in quest of tea., \" Such a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow; and Mrs Smith, observing the high colour in her face, said--, But the chair would never do., Anne knew not how to understand it., Could Anne wonder that her father and sister were happy?, A name that I am so very well acquainted with; knew the gentleman so well by sight; seen him a hundred times; came to consult me once, I remember, about a trespass of one of his neighbours; farmer's man breaking into his orchard; wall torn down; apples stolen; caught in the fact; and afterwards, contrary to my judgement, submitted to an amicable compromise., Louisa's limbs had escaped., She would not, upon any account, mention her having met with him the second time; luckily Mary did not much attend to their having passed close by him in their earlier walk, but she would have felt quite ill-used by Anne's having actually run against him in the passage, and received his very polite excuses, while she had never been near him at all; no, that cousinly little interview must remain a perfect secret., Came there about the year ---5, I take it., What have they brought you?\", Would you, in short, have renewed the engagement then?\", In a low, cautious voice, he said: -- \"I have been considering what we had best do., First, as being the means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction, and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of; and secondly, as it cuts up a man's youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor grows old sooner than any other man., It succeeded, however; and though Sir Walter must ever look with an evil eye on anyone intending to inhabit that house, and think them infinitely too well off in being permitted to rent it on the highest terms, he was talked into allowing Mr Shepherd to proceed in the treaty, and authorising him to wait on Admiral Croft, who still remained at Taunton, and fix a day for the house being seen., I can understand., \"None, I thank you, unless you will give me the pleasure of your company the little way our road lies together., They had a concert bill between them., Sophy must write, and beg him to come to Bath., Mr Shepherd, a civil, cautious lawyer, who, whatever might be his hold or his views on Sir Walter, would rather have the disagreeable prompted by anybody else, excused himself from offering the slightest hint, and only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent judgement of Lady Russell, from whose known good sense he fully expected to have just such resolute measures advised as he meant to see finally adopted., It was impossible for her to enter on such a subject; and yet, after a pause, feeling the necessity of speaking, and having not the smallest wish for a total change, she only deviated so far as to say--, Yes, some share of the tenderness of the past., To pacify Mary, and perhaps screen her own embarrassment, Anne did move quietly to the window., Depend upon me for taking care that no tenant has more than his just rights., His cold politeness, his ceremonious grace, were worse than anything., Who could it be?, She is never tired of playing., Anne had never submitted more reluctantly to the jealous and ill-judging claims of Mary; but so it must be, and they set off for the town, Charles taking care of his sister, and Captain Benwick attending to her., \" But not a bit did Walter stir., He would gladly weaken, by any fair means, whatever feelings or speculations concerning him might exist; and he went, therefore, to his brother's, meaning after a while to return to Kellynch, and act as circumstances might require., \", There were many things to be taken into the account., and so late!, The Miss Musgroves agreed to it; and having all kindly watched him as far up the hill as they could, they returned to the breakfast table., , I was looking at the horses; but I think he had something of the Elliot countenance, Captain Wentworth, however, came from his window, apparently not ill-disposed for conversation; but Charles Hayter soon put an end to his attempts by seating himself near the table, and taking up the newspaper; and Captain Wentworth returned to his window., There was no wound, no blood, no visible bruise; but her eyes were closed, she breathed not, her face was like death., The half hour was chatted away pleasantly enough; and she was not at all surprised at the end of it, to have their walking party joined by both the Miss Musgroves, at Mary's particular invitation., I thought them particularly pleasing, and I will answer for it, they would generally please.\", \" Anne could do no more; but her heart prophesied some mischance to damp the perfection of her felicity., oh!, In music she had been always used to feel alone in the world; and Mr and Mrs Musgrove's fond partiality for their own daughters' performance, and total indifference to any other person's, gave her much more pleasure for their sakes, than mortification for her own., They were not the same, but they were, perhaps, equally good., Their interesting, almost too interesting conversation must be broken up for a time, but slight was the penance compared with the happiness which brought it on!, \"Elliot!, Look, he sees us; he kisses his hand to you; he takes you for my wife., Chapter 1 Sir Walter Elliot, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who, for his own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage; there he found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a distressed one; there his faculties were roused into admiration and respect, by contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents; there any unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs changed naturally into pity and contempt as he turned over the almost endless creations of the last century; and there, if every other leaf were powerless, he could read his own history with an interest which never failed., \"This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family, long before you returned to it; and Colonel Wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it, though he did not then visit in Camden Place; but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there, and when Mr Elliot came to Bath for a day or two, as he happened to do a little before Christmas, Colonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things, and the reports beginning to prevail., Mr Elliot was too generally agreeable., Mrs Musgrove thinks all her servants so steady, that it would be high treason to call it in question; but I am sure, without exaggeration, that her upper house-maid and laundry-maid, instead of being in their business, are gadding about the village, all day long., The chair was earnestly protested against, and Mrs Musgrove, who thought only of one sort of illness, having assured herself with some anxiety, that there had been no fall in the case; that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down, and got a blow on her head, Could she have believed it a week ago; three hours ago!, I should like to know his present opinion, as to the probability of the event he has been in dread of; whether he considers the danger to be lessening or not.\", The Wallises, she had amusement in understanding them., There could not be a doubt, to her mind there was none, of what would follow her recovery., You do us justice, indeed., \"He must wish her good night; he was going; he should get home as fast as he could.\", Come, and tell me., Captain Wentworth now hurried off to get everything ready on his part, and to be soon followed by the two ladies., When I talked of a whole history, therefore, you see I was not romancing so much as you supposed.\", I can only say, `No, I shall not;' and then they say again, `Yes, you will,' and there is an end of it.\", \"How is Mary?\" said Elizabeth; and without waiting for an answer, \"And pray what brings the Crofts to Bath?\", Anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again., His manners were an immediate recommendation; and on conversing with him she found the solid so fully supporting the superficial, that she was at first, as she told Anne, almost ready to exclaim,, I can never get by this shop without stopping., \" She had hardly spoken the words when Mr Elliot walked in., The real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were, that the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome, hopeless son; and the good fortune to lose him before he reached his twentieth year; that he had been sent to sea because he was stupid and unmanageable on shore; that he had been very little cared for at any time by his family, though quite as much as he deserved; seldom heard of, and scarcely at all regretted, when the intelligence of his death abroad had worked its way to Uppercross, two years before., But I am afraid; and I should be so very sorry., \"By all means, my dear,\" cried Mrs Musgrove, \"go home directly, and take care of yourself, that you may be fit for the evening., I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel, when the right moment occurs., He has no feeling for others., At the same time, however, it was a secret gratification to herself to have seen her cousin, and to know that the future owner of Kellynch was undoubtedly a gentleman, and had an air of good sense., She thought of her father, of Lady Russell., In person, she was inferior to both sisters, and had, even in her bloom, only reached the dignity of being \"a fine girl., If the girl likes another man better, it is very fit she should have him.\", \"To be sure I will, if you wish it., With all these circumstances, recollections and feelings, she could not hear that Captain Wentworth's sister was likely to live at Kellynch without a revival of former pain; and many a stroll, and many a sigh, were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea., If Louisa recovered, it would all be well again., \"I must take leave to observe, Sir Walter,\" said Mr Shepherd one morning at Kellynch Hall, as he laid down the newspaper, \"that the present juncture is much in our favour., Who is it?, Then returning to his former earnest tone--, Oh! dear!, The varieties in the fitting-up of the rooms, where the common necessaries provided by the owner, in the common indifferent plight, were contrasted with some few articles of a rare species of wood, excellently worked up, and with something curious and valuable from all the distant countries Captain Harville had visited, were more than amusing to Anne; connected as it all was with his profession, the fruit of its labours, the effect of its influence on his habits, the picture of repose and domestic happiness it presented, made it to her a something more, or less, than gratification., She could not, however, reach such a degree of certainty, as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject at the other house, where the Crofts had previously been calling., Instead of staying at Lyme, he went off to Plymouth, and then he went off to see Edward., That she is old and sickly., \"We must be decided, and without the loss of another minute., she was only Anne., Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been the retarding weight, the doubt, the torment., Lady Russell confessed she had expected something better; but yet \"it was an acquaintance worth having;\" and when Anne ventured to speak her opinion of them to Mr Elliot, he agreed to their being nothing in themselves, but still maintained that, as a family connexion, as good company, as those who would collect good company around them, they had their value., Till it does come, you know, we women never mean to have anybody., He must love her., In the warmth of the moment, and under a mistaken impression, I might, perhaps, have endeavoured to interest you in some circumstances; but not now., It was certainly carried nearly as far as possible, for they met every morning, and hardly ever spent an evening asunder; but she believed they should not have done so well without the sight of Mr and Mrs Musgrove's respectable forms in the usual places, or without the talking, laughing, and singing of their daughters., But I will try to command myself., But here comes a friend, Captain Brigden; I shall only say, `How d'ye do?', It was growing quite dusk, however, before they were in the neighbourhood of Uppercross, and there had been total silence among them for some time, Henrietta leaning back in the corner, with a shawl over her face, giving the hope of her having cried herself to sleep; when, as they were going up their last hill, Anne found herself all at once addressed by Captain Wentworth., \"Well, well, ladies are the best judges; but James Benwick is rather too piano for me; and though very likely it is all our partiality, Sophy and I cannot help thinking Frederick's manners better than his., She deprecated the connexion in every light., That brother had been long removed from the country and being a sensible man, and, moreover, a single man at the time, she had a fond dependence on no human creature's having heard of it from him., There they exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had once before seemed to secure everything, but which had been followed by so many, many years of division and estrangement., The lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties, and promise to stay., Her own spirits improved by change of place and subject, by being removed three miles from Kellynch; Mary's ailments lessened by having a constant companion, and their daily intercourse with the other family, since there was neither superior affection, confidence, nor employment in the cottage, to be interrupted by it, was rather an advantage., I never saw quite so wretched an example of what a sea-faring life can do; but to a degree, I know it is the same with them all, Elizabeth had been lately forming an intimacy, which she wished to see interrupted., \"They would look around them, no doubt, and bless their good fortune,\" said Mrs Clay, for Mrs Clay was present: her father had driven her over, nothing being of so much use to Mrs Clay's health as a drive to Kellynch:, Either of them would, in all probability, make him an affectionate, good-humoured wife., Oh!, The part which provoked her most, was that in all this waste of foresight and caution, she should have lost the right moment for seeing whether he saw them., Miss Elliot, surrounded by her cousins, and the principal object of Colonel Wallis's gallantry, was quite contented., \"The next time you write to your good father, Miss Elliot, pray give him my compliments and Mrs Croft's, and say that we are settled here quite to our liking, and have no fault at all to find with the place., Anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion, answers to urgent applications from Mrs Smith, which all breathed the same stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble, and, under a cold civility, the same hard-hearted indifference to any of the evils it might bring on her., They did not know., She had rather play., \" But he must not be addressing his reflections to Anne alone: he knew it; he was soon diffused again among the others, and it was only at intervals that he could return to Lyme., The neglect had been visited on the head of the sinner; for when poor Lady Elliot died herself, no letter of condolence was received at Kellynch, and, consequently, there was but too much reason to apprehend that the Dalrymples considered the relationship as closed., It is rather from feeling how impossible it is, with all one's efforts, and all one's sacrifices, to make the accommodations on board such as women ought to have., Lady Russell felt this break-up of the family exceedingly., \"No, nothing at all.\", Four-and-twenty hours later, and I should only have been a gallant Captain Wentworth, in a small paragraph at one corner of the newspapers; and being lost in only a sloop, nobody would have thought about me.\", If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child, I should not be able to persuade him to do anything he did not like., Captain Harville smiled, as much as to say, \"Do you claim that for your sex?\", At any rate, said I, it will be better than a long engagement.\", Then she had, indeed, been a pitiable object; for she had caught cold on the journey, and had hardly taken possession of her lodgings before she was again confined to her bed and suffering under severe and constant pain; and all this among strangers, with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse, and finances at that moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense., There is always something offensive in the details of cunning., There, take my arm; that's right; I do not feel comfortable if I have not a woman there., She distrusted the past, if not the present., \"Mary is good-natured enough in many respects,\" said she; \"but she does sometimes provoke me excessively, by her nonsense and pride--the Elliot pride., She could not contemplate the change as implying less., His collar-bone was found to be dislocated, and such injury received in the back, as roused the most alarming ideas., The Baronet will never set the Thames on fire, but there seems to be no harm in him.\", Uppercross, the necessity of some one's going to Uppercross; the news to be conveyed; how it could be broken to Mr and Mrs Musgrove; the lateness of the morning; an hour already gone since they ought to have been off; the impossibility of being in tolerable time., Young and gentle as she was, it might yet have been possible to withstand her father's ill-will, though unsoftened by one kind word or look on the part of her sister; but Lady Russell, whom she had always loved and relied on, could not, with such steadiness of opinion, and such tenderness of manner, be continually advising her in vain., Could the knowledge have been extended through her family?, This could not be pardoned., And there was silence between them for a little while., How would it all be?, Leave me, and go to him., You talk of being proud; I am called proud, I know, and I shall not wish to believe myself otherwise; for our pride, if investigated, would have the same object, I have no doubt, though the kind may seem a little different., The park would be open to him of course, and few navy officers, or men of any other description, can have had such a range; but what restrictions I might impose on the use of the pleasure-grounds, is another thing., There can be no doubt of its having been of the greatest service to Dr Shirley, after his illness, last spring twelve-month., After a moment's pause he said: \"Though I came only yesterday, I have equipped myself properly for Bath already, you see,\" (pointing to a new umbrella); \"I wish you would make use of it,, She had too old a regard for him to be so wholly estranged as might in two meetings extinguish, And, pray, who is Charles Hayter?, The evening ended with dancing., I happened to be at Lyme.\", She was obliged to kneel down by the sofa, and remain there to satisfy her patient; and thus they continued a few minutes, when, to her very great satisfaction, she heard some other person crossing the little vestibule., She had never considered herself as entitled to reward for not slighting an old friend like Mrs Smith, but here was a reward indeed springing from it!, and Mr Elliot so anxious that he should!\", Anne smiled more than once to herself during this speech, and entered into the subject, as ready to do good by entering into the feelings of a young lady as of a young man, though here it was good of a lower standard, for what could be offered but general, You can slip in from the shrubbery at any time; and there you will find we keep our umbrellas hanging up by that door., They are parting; they are shaking hands., \"No!\" said Charles Musgrove, and, The Harvilles had promised to come with her and stay at Uppercross, whenever she returned., I had been unguarded., Sir Walter has resented it., Mrs Croft's brother?\", The theatre or the rooms, where he was most likely to be, were not fashionable enough for the Elliots, whose evening amusements were solely in the elegant stupidity of private parties, in which they were getting more and more engaged; and Anne, wearied of such a state of stagnation, sick of knowing nothing, and fancying herself stronger because her strength was not tried, was quite impatient for the concert evening., It is a very fair match, as times go; and I have liked Charles Hayter all my life, and I shall not leave off now.\", I am glad I was not a week later then., My heart bled for you, as I talked of happiness; and yet he is sensible, he is agreeable, and with such a woman as you, it was not absolutely hopeless., Fanny Harville was a very superior creature, and his attachment to her was indeed attachment., She watched, observed, reflected, and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude or of resignation only., She could do justice to the superiority of Lady Russell's motives in this, over those of her father and Elizabeth; she could honour all the better feelings of her calmness; but the general air of oblivion among them was highly important from whatever it sprung; and in the event of Admiral Croft's really taking Kellynch Hall, she rejoiced anew over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her, of the past being known to those three only among her connexions, by whom no syllable, she believed, would ever be whispered, and in the trust that among his, the brother only with whom he had been residing, had received any information of their short-lived engagement., I have not seen a creature the whole morning!\", Nursing does not belong to a man; it is not his province., Captain Harville had never been in good health since a severe wound which he received two years before, and Captain Wentworth's anxiety to see him had determined him to go immediately to Lyme., There was one circumstance in the history of her grievances of particular irritation., What a blessing to young people to be in such hands!, I have loved none but you., He seems to have a calm decided temper, not at all open to dangerous impressions., They were all at her disposal., Mr Musgrove was, in a lesser degree, affected likewise; and when they reached the cottage, they were evidently in want, first, of being listened to anew on this subject, and afterwards, of all the relief which cheerful companions could give them., Her making a fourth, when they sat down to dinner, was noticed as an advantage., Mrs Clay,\" said she, warmly, \"never forgets who she is; and as I am rather better acquainted with her sentiments than you can be, I can assure you, that upon the subject of marriage they are particularly nice, and that she reprobates all inequality of condition and rank more strongly than most people., they are all at Uppercross., If I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once, remember that it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety, not of risk., \"But it rains.\", It was, perhaps, one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the event decides; and for myself, I certainly never should, in any circumstance of tolerable similarity, give such advice., \"And I am sure,\" cried Mary, warmly, \"it was a very little to his credit, if he did., To be sure by next week I may be allowed to think it all settled, and build my own selfish schemes on Mr Elliot's good fortune.\", She could not call herself an invalid now, compared with her state on first reaching Bath., I could have no other pleasure., Anne enquired after Captain Benwick, Mary's face was clouded directly., It was on this point that she had hoped to engage Anne's good offices with Mr Elliot., He could refer Sir Walter to all who knew him; and certainly, the pains he had been taking on this, the first opportunity of reconciliation, to be restored to the footing of a relation and heir-presumptive, was a strong proof of his opinions on the subject., This long meadow bordered a lane, which their footpath, at the end of it was to cross, and when the party had all reached the gate of exit, the carriage advancing in the same direction, which had been some time heard, was just coming up, and proved to be Admiral Croft's gig., I know what it is, for Mr Musgrove always attends the assizes, and I am so glad when they are over, and he is safe back again., \"It is over!, It was unvarying, warm admiration everywhere; but this intimate footing was not more than established, when a certain Charles Hayter returned among them, to be a good deal disturbed by it, and to think Captain Wentworth very much in the way., they spent together:, I am not particularly disposed to favour a tenant., I do not think she has been in this house three times this summer.\", Is this true?, He got up and moved away., No, it was not to be supposed that Lady Russell would perceive him till they were nearly opposite., This distinction appeared to increase, and there was one speech of Louisa's which struck her., She wanted her to be more known., It was creditable to have a sister married, and she might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental to the connexion, by keeping Anne with her in the autumn; and as her own sister must be better than her husband's sisters, it was very agreeable that Captain Wentworth should be a richer man than either Captain Benwick or Charles Hayter., It would be of no use to go to Uppercross again, for that other Miss Musgrove, I find, is bespoke by her cousin, the young parson., She had left the instrument on the dancing being over, and he had sat down to try to make out an air which he wished to give the Miss Musgroves an idea of., He is a man,\" said Lady Russell, \"whom I have no wish to see., , they parted from Captain and Mrs Harville at their own door, and still accompanied by Captain Benwick, who seemed to cling to them to the last, proceeded to make the proper adieus to the Cobb., He was to come to breakfast, but not at the Cottage, though that had been proposed at first; but then he had been pressed to come to the Great House instead, and he seemed afraid of being in Mrs Charles Musgrove's way, on account of the child, and therefore, somehow, they hardly knew how, it ended in Charles's being to meet him to breakfast at his father's., Her eye half met Captain Wentworth's, a bow, a curtsey passed; she heard his voice; he talked to Mary, said all that was right, said something to the Miss Musgroves, enough to mark an easy footing; the room seemed full, full of persons and voices, but a few minutes ended it., Facts shall speak., I had not waited even these ten days, \" At first, they were capable of nothing more to the purpose than such exclamations; but, after a while, Captain Wentworth, exerting himself, said--, \"No, no, it is not man's nature., To be claimed as a good, though in an improper style, is at least better than being rejected as no good at all; and Anne, glad to be thought of some use, glad to have anything marked out as a duty, and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country, and her own dear country, readily agreed to stay., Oh!, \", \"Yes, here I am, Sophia, quite ready to make a foolish match., So passed the first three weeks., They had travelled half their way along the rough lane, before she was quite awake to what they said., and she answered the question, smiling also, \"Yes., They had been all in lodgings together., Anne's mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment of the evening; it was just occupation enough: she had feelings for the tender, spirits for the gay, attention for the scientific, and patience for the wearisome; and had never liked a concert better, at least during the first act., I want your interest with him., she would not have forgotten him so soon!\", And I will tell you our reason,\" she added, \"and all about it., \"It was you, and not your sister, I find, that my brother had the pleasure of being acquainted with, when he was in this country.\", She was just in time to ascertain that it really was Mr Elliot, which she had never believed, before he disappeared on one side, as Mrs Clay walked quickly off on the other; and checking the surprise which she could not but feel at such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons of totally opposite interest, she calmly said, \"Yes, it is Mr Elliot, certainly., But now for Louisa., \"A very fine young man indeed!\" said Lady Dalrymple., His daughter and Mrs Clay united in hinting that Colonel Wallis's companion might have as good a figure as Colonel Wallis, and certainly was not sandy-haired., Hers is a line for seeing human nature; and she has a fund of good sense and observation, which, as a companion, make her infinitely superior to thousands of those who having only received `the best education in the world,' know nothing worth attending to., When this was told, his name distressed her no longer., \"I thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young man,\" said Anne, \"and I understand that he bears an excellent character.\", and though Anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride, she was pleased with him for not liking Mrs Clay; and her conscience admitted that his wishing to promote her father's getting great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her., How her temper and understanding might bear the investigation of his present keener time of life was another concern and rather a fearful one., you may as well take back that tiresome book she would lend me, and pretend I have read it through., he was surprised at that;\" and added, \"certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are; you cannot be better than well; or I should recommend Gowland, the constant use of Gowland, during the spring months., I wonder whereabouts they will upset to-day., This is always my luck., The scenes in its neighbourhood, Charmouth, with its high grounds and extensive sweeps of country, and still more, its sweet, retired bay, backed by dark cliffs, where fragments of low rock among the sands, make it the happiest spot for watching the flow of the tide, for sitting in unwearied contemplation; the woody varieties of the cheerful village of Up Lyme; and, above all, Pinny, with its green chasms between romantic rocks, where the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth, declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state, where a scene so wonderful and so lovely is exhibited, as may more than equal any of the resembling scenes of the far-famed Isle of Wight: these places must be visited, and visited again, to make the worth of Lyme understood., , I declare, but it must be very bad., \"And that you are very likely to do very soon, I can tell you, ma'am,\" said Charles., No, I believe you capable of everything great and good in your married lives., One wonders how the names of many of our nobility become so common.\", Strangers filling their place!\", \", Sir Walter spurned the idea of its being offered in any manner; forbad the slightest hint being dropped of his having such an intention; and it was only on the supposition of his being spontaneously solicited by some most unexceptionable applicant, on his own terms, and as a great favour, that he would let it at all., She was lost, and when she had scolded back her senses, she found the others still waiting for the carriage, and Mr Elliot (always obliging) just setting off for Union Street on a commission of Mrs Clay's., What a great traveller you must have been, ma'am!\" said Mrs Musgrove to Mrs Croft., She had no child to connect her with life and happiness again, no relations to assist in the arrangement of perplexed affairs, no health to make all the rest supportable., \"I have not the smallest objection on that account,\" replied Anne., He cannot bear the idea of not being Sir William., I shall have done in five minutes.\", You can imagine what an artful man would do; and with this guide, perhaps, may recollect what you have seen him do.\", \"No. Was not it Mrs Speed, as usual, or the maid?, Even if your own feelings were reluctant or indifferent, to consider what powerful supports would be his!, It was three weeks since she had heard at all., One of five thousand Mr Smiths whose names are to be met with everywhere., \"I have not seen Mr Elliot these three years,\" was Mrs Smith's answer, given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther; and Anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity., It only added a dangerous character to himself., When he came back, alas!, To finish the interest of the story, the friendship between him and the Harvilles seemed, if possible, augmented by the event which closed all their views of alliance, and Captain Benwick was now living with them entirely., A man does not recover from such a devotion of the heart to such a woman., The Mr Musgroves had their own game to guard, and to destroy, their own horses, dogs, and newspapers to engage them, and the females were fully occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping, neighbours, dress, dancing, and music., Chapter 16, This was an article not to be entered on by himself; but a very intimate friend of his, a Colonel Wallis, a highly respectable man, perfectly the gentleman, (and not an ill-looking man, Sir Walter added), who was living in very good style in Marlborough Buildings, and had, at his own particular request, been admitted to their acquaintance through Mr Elliot, had mentioned one or two things relative to the marriage, which made a material difference in the discredit of it., All the surprise and suspense, and every other painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation, she re-entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy in some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last., Always to be presented with the date of her own birth and see no marriage follow, Captain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgrove's civility, and she was all but calling there in the same half hour., \"There is hardly any personal defect,\" replied Anne, \"which an agreeable manner might not gradually reconcile one to.\", And yet, a few minutes afterwards, she felt as if their being in company with each other, under their present circumstances, could only be exposing them to inadvertencies and misconstructions of the most mischievous kind., Mr Shepherd was completely empowered to act; and no sooner had such an end been reached, than Anne, who had been a most attentive listener to the whole, left the room, to seek the comfort of cool air for her flushed cheeks; and as she walked along a favourite grove, said, with a gentle sigh, \"A few months more, and he, perhaps, may be walking here.\", Anne was astonished to recognise the same hills and the same objects so soon., \"Yes,\" said he, looking not exactly forward; \", \"Yes,\" said Mrs Smith more doubtingly, \"sometimes it may, though I fear its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe., \"Not at all, not at all; there is not an oath or a murmur from beginning to end., I have known a face not materially disfigured by a few, but he abominates them., \"I had not the smallest intention of asking him,\" said Elizabeth, with affected carelessness, \"but he gave so many hints; so Mrs Clay says, at least.\", It had been begun several days back. \", ; whenever my uncle dies, he steps into very pretty property., \"I think you are very likely to suffer the most of the two; your feelings are less reconciled to the change than mine., After another short silence--, Had Lady Dalrymple and her daughter even been very agreeable, she would still have been ashamed of the agitation they created, but they were nothing., Very odd indeed!, He very handsomely hopes they will be happy together; and there is nothing very unforgiving in that, I think., This may be bad morality to conclude with, but I believe it to be truth; and if such parties succeed, how should a Captain Wentworth and an Anne Elliot, with the advantage of maturity of mind, consciousness of right, and one independent fortune between them, fail of bearing down every opposition?, This will not do., Anne thought she left great happiness behind her when they quitted the house; and Louisa, by whom she found herself walking, burst forth into raptures of admiration and delight on the character of the navy; their friendliness, their brotherliness, their openness, their uprightness; protesting that she was convinced of sailors having more worth and warmth than any other set of men in England; that they only knew how to live, and they only deserved to be respected and loved., , it immediately occurred, that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he loved, and she had been hastily preparing to interest Anne's feelings, as far as the observances due to Mr Elliot's character would allow, when Anne's refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of everything; and while it took from her the new-formed hope of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety, left her at least the comfort of telling the whole story her own way., There are on both sides good principles and good temper.\", They will be all wanting a home., He said he should not stay out long; but he has never come back, and now it is almost one., He fancied that if he went with us, he should find you close by: he fancied everybody to be living in Uppercross; and when he discovered that Lady Russell lived three miles off, his heart failed him, and he had not courage to come., The elegant little clock on the mantel- piece had struck \"eleven with its silver sounds,\" and the watchman was beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale, before Mr Elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he had been there long., She could determine nothing at present., But the men are all wild after Miss Elliot., Anne saw the misery of such feelings., He had spent his whole solitary evening in the room adjoining theirs; had heard voices, mirth continually; thought they must be a most delightful set of people, longed to be with them, but certainly without the smallest suspicion of his possessing the shadow of a right to introduce himself., Your father might have asked us to dinner, I think, if he had wanted to see us., His acquittal was complete, his friendship warmly honoured, a lively interest excited for his friend, and his description of the fine country about Lyme so feelingly attended to by the party, that an earnest desire to see Lyme themselves, and a project for going thither was the consequence., Here,\" said he, \"ended the worst of my state; for now I could at least put myself in the way of happiness; I could exert myself; I could do something., There was no difference between him and the man who had stood on the steps at Lyme, admiring Anne as she passed, except in the air and look and manner of the privileged relation and friend., There had been a time, when of all the large party now filling the drawing-room at Uppercross, they would have found it most difficult to cease to speak to one another., Did he see you last summer or autumn, `somewhere down in the west,' to use her own words, without knowing it to be you?\", \"No, I thank you: no, certainly not., Lady Russell said not another word, willing to leave the matter to its own operation; and believing that, could Mr Elliot at that moment with propriety have spoken for himself!--she believed, in short, what Anne did not believe., You may guess, therefore, that the news he heard from his friend could not be very agreeable, and you may guess what it produced; the resolution of coming back to Bath as soon as possible, and of fixing himself here for a time, with the view of renewing his former acquaintance, and recovering such a footing in the family as might give him the means of ascertaining the degree of his danger, and of circumventing the lady if he found it material., Do not you hear your aunt speak?, They described the drawing-room window-curtains of one of the houses on this side of the way, and this part of the street, as being the handsomest and best hung of any in Bath, but could not recollect the exact number, and I have been trying to find out which it could be; but I confess I can see no curtains hereabouts that answer their description.\", I have been to the theatre, and secured a box for to-morrow night., My father was certainly disposed to take very kind and proper notice of him., And in short, she said more than her husband could long withstand, and as none of the others could oppose when he gave way, there was no help for it, His opinion of Louisa Musgrove's inferiority, an opinion which he had seemed solicitous to give, his wonder at Captain Benwick, his feelings as to a first, strong attachment; sentences begun which he could not finish, his half averted eyes and more than half expressive glance, all, all declared that he had a heart returning to her at least; that anger, resentment, avoidance, were no more; and that they were succeeded, not merely by friendship and regard, but by the tenderness of the past., He had condescended to mortgage as far as he had the power, but he would never condescend to sell., He walked by her side., There had been the charm., She even addressed him once, and looked at him more than once., Anne herself would have found the mortifications of it more than she foresaw, and to Sir Walter's feelings they must have been dreadful., You were single., Mrs Clay has been using it at my recommendation, and you see what it has done for her., Towards the close of it, in the interval succeeding an Italian song, she explained the words of the song to Mr Elliot., He wanted to know how early he might be admitted to-morrow., It seems, on the contrary, to have been a perfectly spontaneous, untaught feeling on his side, and this surprises me., Her faith was plighted, and Mr Elliot's character, like the Sultaness Scheherazade's head, must live another day., The rain was a mere trifle, and Anne was most sincere in preferring a walk with Mr Elliot., The visit passed off altogether in high good humour., As she joined him, Captain Harville's countenance re-assumed the serious, thoughtful expression which seemed its natural character., She had, while a very young girl, as soon as she had known him to be, in the event of her having no brother, the future baronet, meant to marry him, and her father had always meant that she should., Westgate Buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance of a carriage drawn up near its pavement,\" observed Sir Walter. \", \"She is dead!, She knew that when she played she was giving pleasure only to herself; but this was no new sensation., Captain Wentworth turned in to call on his friend; the others walked on, and he was to join them on the Cobb., Mrs Smith would hardly have believed so soon in Mr Elliot's failure, but from the perception of there being a somebody else., He promised me the sight of a capital gun he is just going to send off; said he would keep it unpacked to the last possible moment, that I might see it; and if I do not turn back now, I have no chance., You might, some time or other, be differently affected towards him., Their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit from Miss Elliot would give Mrs Smith, and Anne therefore lost no time in going., Between these two, she could want no possible attendance by day or night., Knowing their feelings as she did, it was a most attractive picture of happiness to her., I am sure I had not., We are not boy and girl, to be captiously irritable, misled by every moment's inadvertence, and wantonly playing with our own happiness.\", \"Well, whenever it suits you., Oh!, You see he cannot put the card out of his hand.\", Anne was tenderness itself, and she had the full worth of it in Captain Wentworth's affection., \"Colonel Wallis!, No., No second attachment, the only thoroughly natural, happy, and sufficient cure, at her time of life, had been possible to the nice tone of her mind, the fastidiousness of her taste, in the small limits of the society around them., she could get near her, and who, consequently, was only too happy in being allowed to go and help nurse dear Miss Louisa., All that she could tell she told most gladly, but the all was little for one who had been there, and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as Mrs Smith, who had already heard, through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter, rather more of the general success and produce of the evening than Anne could relate, and who now asked in vain for several particulars of the company., She always watched them as long as she could, delighted to fancy she understood what they might be talking of, as they walked along in happy independence, or equally delighted to see the Admiral's hearty shake of the hand when he encountered an old friend, and observe their eagerness of conversation when occasionally forming into a little knot of the navy, Mrs Croft looking as intelligent and keen as any of the officers around her., He had seen Mrs Croft, too; she was at Taunton with the admiral, and had been present almost all the time they were talking the matter over. \", \"My dear Frederick, you are talking quite idly., They have no difficulties to contend with at home, no opposition, no caprice, no delays., He hoped she might make some amends for the many very plain faces he was continually passing in the streets., He considered his disposition as of the sort which must suffer heavily, uniting very strong feelings with quiet, serious, and retiring manners, and a decided taste for reading, and sedentary pursuits., \"Yes; you see his papa can, and why should not I?, His two other children were of very inferior value., They are both so very large, and take up so much room; and Mr Musgrove always sits forward., I was startled and shocked., She then found them talking of \"Frederick.\", but Charles would be a very shocking match for Henrietta, and indeed it could not be; he is the only one that could be possible; but he is a very good-natured, good sort of a fellow; and whenever Winthrop comes into his hands, he will make a different sort of place of it, and live in a very different sort of way; and with that property, he will never be a contemptible man--good, freehold property., That he did not regard it as a desperate case, that he did not say a few hours must end it, was at first felt, beyond the hope of most; and the ecstasy of such a reprieve, the rejoicing, deep and silent, after a few fervent ejaculations of gratitude to Heaven had been offered, may be conceived., To begin without knowing that at such a time there will be the means of marrying, I hold to be very unsafe and unwise, and what I think all parents should prevent as far as they can.\", and I had such a lovely cruise together off the Western Islands., I am sick of it., Mr Elliot looking up with so much respect.\", \"I could manage them very well, if it were not for Mary's interference,\" was what Anne often heard him say, and had a good deal of faith in; but when listening in turn to Mary's reproach of \"Charles spoils the children so that I cannot get them into any order,\" she never had the smallest temptation to say, \"Very true., A most improper match for Miss Musgrove of Uppercross.\", \"Do you think so?, \"To be sure I did; very often., Mrs Charles Musgrove will, of course, wish to get back to her children; but if Anne will stay, no one so proper, so capable as Anne.\", You are forced on exertion., \"Yes, as long as I could bear their noise; but they are so unmanageable that they do me more harm than good., We sailors, Miss Elliot, cannot afford to make long courtships in time of war., \"The Ibbotsons, were they there?, You did not use to like cards; but time makes many changes.\", It was but a card party, it was but a mixture of those who had never met before, and those who met too often; a commonplace business, too numerous for intimacy, too small for variety; but Anne had never found an evening shorter., Henrietta looked a little ashamed, but very well pleased;-- Charles Hayter exceedingly happy: and they were devoted to each other almost from the first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross., what a boat it is!\", I think differently now; time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions; but at that period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible in what Mr Elliot was doing., Uppercross was a moderate-sized village, which a few years back had been completely in the old English style, containing only two houses superior in appearance to those of the yeomen and labourers; the mansion of the squire, with its high walls, great gates, and old trees, substantial and unmodernized, and the compact, tight parsonage, enclosed in its own neat garden, with a vine and a pear-tree trained round its casements; but upon the marriage of the young 'squire, it had received the improvement of a farm-house elevated into a cottage, for his residence, and Uppercross Cottage, with its veranda, French windows, and other prettiness, was quite as likely to catch the traveller's eye as the more consistent and considerable aspect and premises of the Great House, about a quarter of a mile farther on., But, fair or not fair, there are unbecoming conjunctions, which reason will patronize in vain-- which taste cannot tolerate--which ridicule will seize., The careless expression was life to Anne, who saw that Captain Wentworth was all attention, looking and listening with his whole soul; and that the last words brought his enquiring eyes from Charles to herself., I am sure, Anne, if you would, you might persuade him that I really am very ill--a great deal worse than I ever own., Mrs Clay's selfishness was not so complicate nor so revolting as his; and Anne would have compounded for the marriage at once, with all its evils, to be clear of Mr Elliot's subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it., They had been thrown together several weeks; they had been living in the same small family party: since Henrietta's coming away, they must have been depending almost entirely on each other, and Louisa, just recovering from illness, had been in an interesting state, and Captain Benwick was not inconsolable., But Mrs Clay was talking so eagerly with Miss Elliot, that she did not hear the appeal., She longed to see the Crofts; but when the meeting took place, it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them., It was the only intelligible motive., Whether former feelings were to be renewed must be brought to the proof; former times must undoubtedly be brought to the recollection of each; they could not but be reverted to; the year of their engagement could not but be named by him, in the little narratives or descriptions which conversation called forth., And who is Admiral Croft?\" was Sir Walter's cold suspicious inquiry., He saw her too; yet he looked grave, and seemed irresolute, and only by very slow degrees came at last near enough to speak to her., Mrs Musgrove and Mrs Hayter were sisters., You see how it has carried away her freckles., The father and mother were in the old English style, and the young people in the new., I assure you I shall not., So I got Sophy to lend me a hand, and we soon shifted their quarters; and now I am quite snug, with my little shaving glass in one corner, and another great thing that I never go near.\", Very few., I will only tell you what I have found him., But I mean, that I was right in submitting to her, and that if I had done otherwise, I should have suffered more in continuing the engagement than I did even in giving it up, because I should have suffered in my conscience., He caught the word; it seemed to rouse him at once, and saying only-- \"True, true, a surgeon this instant,\" was darting away, when Anne eagerly suggested-- \"Captain Benwick, would not it be better for Captain Benwick?, \"No, I did not promise., Without that attraction, not all her money would have tempted Elliot, and Sir Walter was, moreover, assured of her having been a very fine woman., Do not you, Anne?, She knew who had been frequenting Uppercross., She consulted, and in a degree was influenced by her in marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to Sir Walter., I have travelled so little, that every fresh place would be interesting to me; but there is real beauty at Lyme; and in short\" (with a faint blush at some recollections), \"altogether my impressions of the place are very agreeable., However it might end, he was without any question their pleasantest acquaintance in Bath: she saw nobody equal to him; and it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about Lyme, which he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again, and to see more of, as herself., She was a woman rather of sound than of quick abilities, whose difficulties in coming to any decision in this instance were great, from the opposition of two leading principles., Lady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject, and gave it much serious consideration., I observed no one in particular.\", \"Look here,\" said he, unfolding a parcel in his hand, and displaying a small miniature painting, \"do you know who that is?\", \" While her father spoke, there was a knock at the door., She had previously, in the anticipation of their marriage, been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it; but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature, since he did not even know her to be in Bath, \" This brought his sister upon him. \", \"But you must go, Charles., There was a little awkwardness at first in their discourse on another subject., Mary was in excellent spirits, enjoying the gaiety and the change, and so well satisfied with the journey in her mother-in-law's carriage with four horses, and with her own complete independence of Camden Place, that she was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she ought, and enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house, as they were detailed to her., Well, Miss Elliot,\" (lowering his voice,) \"as I was saying we shall never agree, I suppose, upon this point., To consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to influence you!, He knows there must have been twenty better men than himself applying for her at the same time., You will see them both this morning, I dare say., No, no; you were better employed., Personal size and mental sorrow have certainly no necessary proportions., \"I mean to go with you, Charles, for I am of no more use at home than you are., She saw that there had been bad habits; that Sunday travelling had been a common thing; that there had been a period of his life (and probably not a short one) when he had been, at least, careless in all serious matters; and, though he might now think very differently, who could answer for the true sentiments of a clever, cautious man, grown old enough to appreciate a fair character?, you will think very differently, when you are married.', \"There are few among the gentlemen of the navy, I imagine, who would not be surprised to find themselves in a house of this description.\", In mourning, you see, just as our Mr Elliot must be., \"But you, yourself, brought Mrs Harville, her sister, her cousin, and three children, round from Portsmouth to Plymouth., Now, I cannot help thinking it a pity that he does not live entirely by the sea., It would place her in the same village with Captain Wentworth, within half a mile of him; they would have to frequent the same church, and there must be intercourse between the two families., In all probability he was already the richer of the two, and the Kellynch estate would as surely be his hereafter as the title., \", Charles and Mary still talked on in the same style; he, half serious and half jesting, maintaining the scheme for the play, and she, invariably serious, most warmly opposing it, and not omitting to make it known that, however determined to go to Camden Place herself, she should not think herself very well used, if they went to the play without her., His attentive deference to her father, contrasted with his former language, was odious; and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards Mrs Smith, she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness, or the sound of his artificial good sentiments., Irish, I dare say.\", Mutual enquiries on common subjects passed:, The girls were now hunting for the Laconia; and Captain Wentworth could not deny himself the pleasure of taking the precious volume into his own hands to save them the trouble, and once more read aloud, I forget what we are to have next,\" turning to the bill., \"This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliot's life,\" said Anne, \"which has always excited my particular curiosity., \"For shame!, I had heard you described by those who knew you intimately., There was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party; and he was very much questioned, and especially by the two Miss Musgroves, who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him, as to the manner of living on board,, How could I look on without agony?, But even then there was something odd in their way of going on., But it appears--I should hope it would be a very happy match., is, that if in consequence of any rumours getting abroad of your intention; which must be contemplated as a possible thing, because we know how difficult it is to keep the actions and designs of one part of the world from the notice and curiosity of the other; consequence has its tax; I, John Shepherd, might conceal any family-matters that I chose, for, He was not allowed to escape, however., \"I am much obliged to you,\" was her answer, \"but I am not going with them., \" Anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of finding such words applied to her father., and she immediately heard that Mary and Henrietta, too impatient to wait, had gone out the moment it had cleared, but would be back again soon, and that the strictest injunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove to keep her there till they returned., They were by no means tired of wondering and admiring; and not even Louisa seemed to feel that they had parted with Captain Wentworth long, when they saw him coming after them, with three companions, all well known already, by description, to be Captain and Mrs Harville, and a Captain Benwick, who was staying with them., fine part of Dorsetshire., But who else was there to employ?, As to the sad catastrophe itself, it could be canvassed only in one style by a couple of steady, sensible women, whose judgements had to work on ascertained events; and it was perfectly decided that it had been the consequence of much thoughtlessness and much imprudence; that its effects were most alarming, and that it was frightful to think, how long Miss Musgrove's recovery might yet be doubtful, and how liable she would still remain to suffer from the concussion hereafter!, His profession was all that could ever make her friends wish that tenderness less, the dread of a future war all that could dim her sunshine., \"I can explain this too,\" cried Mrs Smith, smiling., It was evident that the gentleman, (completely a gentleman in manner) admired her exceedingly., They were, consequently, to stay the night there, and not to be expected back till the next day's dinner., There could be only the most proper alacrity, a most obliging compliance for public view; and smiles reined in and spirits dancing in private rapture., \" Everybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters; and sounds are quite innoxious, or most distressing, by their sort rather than their quantity., He was then the inferior in circumstances; he was then the poor one; he had chambers in the Temple, and it was as much as he could do to support the appearance of a gentleman., Her friend was not in better spirits than herself., Had it been the effect of gratitude, had he learnt to love her, because he believed her to be preferring him, \"Yes; he was not married when I knew him first.\", Anne, amused in spite of herself, was rather distressed for an answer, and the Admiral, fearing he might not have been civil enough, took up the subject again, to say--, After waiting another moment-- \"You mean Mr Wentworth, I suppose?\" said Anne., He had distinguished himself, and early gained the other step in rank, and must now, by successive captures, have made a handsome fortune., I see it in your eye., One could not be connected with better people., You are your mother's self in countenance and disposition; and if I might be allowed to fancy you such as she was, in situation and name, and home, presiding and blessing in the same spot, and only superior to her in being more highly valued!, She had once partly promised Mrs Smith to spend the evening with her; but in a short hurried call she excused herself and put it off, with the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow., She seemed to be in the middle of some eager speech., Her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance, and their visit in general., He begged their pardon, but he had forgotten his gloves, and instantly crossing the room to the writing table, he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper, placed it before Anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her for a time, and hastily collecting his gloves, was again out of the room, almost before Mrs Musgrove was aware of his being in it: the work of an instant!, Lady Dalrymple had acquired the name of \"a charming woman,\" because she had a smile and a civil answer for everybody., It now became necessary for the party to consider what was best to be done, as to their general situation., \"Now, how I do wish I understood you!, \"Depend upon it, they were all perfectly comfortable.\", \"Yes,\" said he, \"very true; here we separate, but, Mr Elliot, too, it must be remembered, had not been a widower seven months., here is Winthrop., She could not keep her appointment punctually, however; the weather was unfavourable, and she had grieved over the rain on her friends' account, and felt it very much on her own, before she was able to attempt the walk., They are not at all nice children, in my opinion; but Mrs Musgrove seems to like them quite as well, if not better, than her grandchildren., I have more pride than any of you; but I confess it does vex me, that we should be so solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged, which we may be very sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them.\", There was much to regret., And, as to procuring a dispensation, there could be no difficulty at his time of life, and with his character., \"No, no!, It was spoken with enthusiasm. \", It was no insignificant barrier, indeed., But \"they should meet again., Mr Elliot came back accordingly; and on application was forgiven, as you know, and re-admitted into the family; and there it was his constant object, and his only object (till your arrival added another motive), to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay., then added--, but, Charles, tell Captain Wentworth, he need not be afraid of mentioning poor Dick before me, for it would be rather a pleasure to hear him talked of by such a good friend., A sick chamber may often furnish the worth of volumes.\", \"Oh!\" cried Elizabeth, \"I have been rather too much used to the game to be soon overcome by a gentleman's hints., It is really very good of you to come and sit with me, when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time.\", It was really expected to be a good one, and Captain Wentworth was very fond of music., While Captains Wentworth and Harville led the talk on one side of the room, and by recurring to former days, supplied anecdotes in abundance to occupy and entertain the others, it fell to Anne's lot to be placed rather apart with Captain Benwick; and a very good impulse of her nature obliged her to begin an acquaintance with him., Louisa could not listen at all to his account of a conversation which he had just held with Dr Shirley: she was at a window, looking out for Captain Wentworth; and even Henrietta had at best only a divided attention to give, and seemed to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitude of the negotiation., \"Bless me!\", She understood him., I must learn to brook being happier than I deserve.\", It was impossible for her to have forgotten to feel that this arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together again., I fancy?\", \"I will carry her myself., I left you in this belief; and yet, I was determined to see you again., I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it, eight years and a half ago., Thus much indeed he was obliged to acknowledge: that he had been constant unconsciously, nay unintentionally; that he had meant to forget her, and believed it to be done., She had come to Bath on that account, and was now in lodgings near the hot baths, living in a very humble way, unable even to afford herself the comfort of a servant, and of course almost excluded from society., \"Married, December 16, 1810, Charles, son and heir of Charles Musgrove, Esq. of Uppercross, in the county of Somerset,\" and by inserting most accurately the day of the month on which he had lost his wife., \" The next moment she was tapping at her husband's dressing-room door, and as Anne followed her up stairs, she was in time for the whole conversation, which began with Mary's saying, in a tone of great exultation--, Of what he had then written, nothing was to be retracted or qualified., This however was what Lady Russell had now to do., Chapter 11, Once, too, he spoke to her., My account states, that your sister's friend, the lady now staying with you, whom I have heard you mention, came to Bath with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter as long ago as September (in short when they first came themselves), and has been staying there ever since; that she is a clever, insinuating, handsome woman, poor and plausible, and altogether such in situation and manner, as to give a general idea, among Sir Walter's acquaintance, of her meaning to be Lady Elliot, and as general a surprise that Miss Elliot should be apparently, blind to the danger.\", \", And it was not only that her feelings were still adverse to any man save one; her judgement, on a serious consideration of the possibilities of such a case was against Mr Elliot., But Mr Elliot was not done with., We had not been six hours in the Sound, when a gale came on, which lasted four days and nights, and which would have done for poor old Asp in half the time; our touch with the Great Nation not having much improved our condition., \"I must see Captain Benwick before I decide,\" said Lady Russell, smiling., I have no reason, from any thing that has fallen within my observation, to do otherwise., As soon as I could use my hands she taught me to knit, which has been a great amusement; and she put me in the way of making these little thread-cases, pin-cushions and card-racks, which you always find me so busy about, and which supply me with the means of doing a little good to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood., She disliked Bath, and did not think it agreed with her; and Bath was to be her home., , could the gentlemen in brown velvet and the ladies in blue satin have seen what was going on, have been conscious of such an overthrow of all order and neatness!, She was the last, excepting the little boys at the cottage, Mrs Harville says her husband feels a good deal on his poor sister's account; but, however, Louisa is a great favourite with both., Oh!, He had seen you indeed, before he came to Bath, and admired you, but without knowing it to be you., A knock at the door!, They do everything to confer happiness, I am sure., She was obliged to recollect that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour, that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies, that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others, before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter which she had been meditating over, and say--, Anne did think on the question with perfect decision, and said as much in reply as her own feeling could accomplish, or as his seemed able to bear, for he was too much affected to renew the subject, and when he spoke again, it was of something totally different., she was thinking of Lyme and Louisa Musgrove, and all her acquaintance there;, \"I did.\", Their minds most dissimilar!, But I have no reason to suppose it so., Believe it to be most fervent, most undeviating, in F. W., \", I am afraid there had been some mistake; and I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville and Captain Wentworth, that we hope to see them both.\", Eight years and a half is a period., I never knew him myself; I only heard of him; but there was a something in his conduct then, with regard to my father and sister, and afterwards in the circumstances of his marriage, which I never could quite reconcile with present times., \" It was a reference to the future, which Anne, after a little observation, felt she must submit to., \"Phoo! phoo!, The child had a good night, and was going on well the next day., \"I do not know; but I can hardly suppose that, at Admiral Croft's time of life, and in his profession, he should not have many acquaintance in such a place as this.\", Mr Elliot has sense to understand the value of such a woman., A strong mind, with sweetness of manner,\" made the first and the last of the description., When Lady Russell not long afterwards, was entering Bath on a wet afternoon, and driving through the long course of streets from the Old Bridge to Camden Place, amidst the dash of other carriages, the heavy rumble of carts and drays, the bawling of newspapermen, muffin-men and milkmen, and the ceaseless clink of pattens, she made no complaint., It had cost her something to encounter Lady Russell's surprise; and now, if she were by any chance to be thrown into company with Captain Wentworth, her imperfect knowledge of the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him., Sir Walter, without hesitation, declared the Admiral to be the best-looking sailor he had ever met with, and went so far as to say, that if his own man might have had the arranging of his hair, he should not be ashamed of being seen with him any where; and the Admiral, with sympathetic cordiality, observed to his wife as they drove back through the park, \", Mr and Mrs Musgrove took me, and we were so crowded!, \"It was not in her nature., He felt it all, so much for her sake., The news of his cousins Anne's engagement burst on Mr Elliot most unexpectedly., Miss Carteret was with her mother; consequently it was not reasonable to expect accommodation for all the three Camden Place ladies., The Crofts will associate with them., She was very much affected by the view of his disposition towards her, which all these things made apparent., Elizabeth was, for a short time, suffering a good deal., She was always on friendly terms with her brother-in-law; and in the children, who loved her nearly as well, and respected her a great deal more than their mother, she had an object of interest, amusement, and wholesome exertion., I should have thought your last impressions of Lyme must have been strong disgust.\", Some one must resolve on being off for Uppercross instantly., \"Oh! no., I wish he could have such company oftener., \" Just as they were setting off, the gentlemen returned., She roused herself to say, as they struck by order into another path, \"Is not this one of the ways to Winthrop?\", One day last spring, in town, I was in company with two men, striking instances of what I am talking of; Lord St Ives, whose father we all know to have been a country curate, without bread to eat, I wish she had accepted him., Prettier musings of high-wrought love and eternal constancy, could never have passed along the streets of Bath, than Anne was sporting with from Camden Place to Westgate Buildings., Mrs Musgrove was giving Mrs Croft the history of her eldest daughter's engagement, and just in that inconvenient tone of voice which was perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper., She had already been obliged to tell Lady Russell that Louisa Musgrove was to marry Captain Benwick., Henrietta asked him what he thought of you, when they went away, and he said, `You were so altered he should not have known you again.'\", It was transient: cleared away in an instant; but Anne could imagine she read there the consciousness of having, by some complication of mutual trick, or some overbearing authority of his, been obliged to attend (perhaps for half an hour) to his lectures and restrictions on her designs on Sir Walter., \"What is this?\" cried Sir Walter., Her satisfaction in Mr Elliot outweighed all the plague of Mrs Clay., But there was another, and an earlier, which I will now explain., One morning, about this time Charles Musgrove and Captain Wentworth being gone a-shooting together,, \" \"I hardly know,\" replied Captain Wentworth, surprised., Worse than all!, How so?, Lady Dalrymple's carriage, for which Miss Elliot was growing very impatient, now drew up; the servant came in to announce it., There was no superiority of manner, accomplishment, or understanding., Charles, if you see Captain Harville anywhere, remember to give Miss Anne's message., On the morning appointed for Admiral and Mrs Croft's seeing Kellynch Hall, Anne found it most natural to take her almost daily walk to Lady Russell's, and keep out of the way till all was over; when she found it most natural to be sorry that she had missed the opportunity of seeing them., He will rally again, and be happy with another., Sailors work hard enough for their comforts, we must all allow.\", He had passed out of the room without a look!, the young couple there were more disposed to speculate and wonder; and Captain Wentworth had not been above four or five times in the Miss Musgroves' company, and Charles Hayter had but just reappeared, when Anne had to listen to the opinions of her brother and sister, as to which was the one liked best., It will be a great deal better than leaving him only with Jemima., And take it altogether, now that we have been into most of the houses hereabouts and can judge, there is not one that we like better than this., \"But for my satisfaction, if you will have the goodness to ring for Mary; stay: I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of going yourself into my bedroom, and bringing me the small inlaid box which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet.\", It was a very fine November day, and the Miss Musgroves came through the little grounds, and stopped for no other purpose than to say, that they were going to take a long walk, and therefore concluded Mary could not like to go with them; and when Mary immediately replied, with some jealousy at not being supposed a good walker, \"Oh, yes, I should like to join you very much, I am very fond of a long walk;\" Anne felt persuaded, by the looks of the two girls, that it was precisely what they did not wish, and admired again the sort of necessity which the family habits seemed to produce, of everything being to be communicated, and everything being to be done together, however undesired and inconvenient., He made it his business to go to Lyme, and his account was still encouraging., They went to the sands, to watch the flowing of the tide, which a fine south-easterly breeze was bringing in with all the grandeur which so flat a shore admitted., The carriage is gone to-day, to bring Louisa and the Harvilles to-morrow., Well, my dear Miss Elliot, I hope and trust, I did invite him, you know., It is a sort of pain, too, which is new to me., Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever., One morning, very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves, at which Anne had not been present, Captain Wentworth walked into the drawing-room at the Cottage, where were only herself and the little invalid Charles, who was lying on the sofa., Anne smiled, and let it pass., \"Nothing can be going on better than the child,\" said he; \"so I told my father, just now, that I would come, and he thought me quite right., One would imagine you had never heard my father speak of her personal misfortunes, though I know you must fifty times., For an old built sloop, you would not see her equal., You were a large party in yourselves, and you wanted nothing beyond.\", She never did, you know., (there was no occasion for remembering Mary); and Anne, smiling and blushing, very becomingly shewed to Mr Elliot, Her happiness was from within., His sister had a letter from him yesterday, in which he tells us of it, and he had just had it in a letter from Harville, written upon the spot, from Uppercross., Mr and Mrs Musgrove were a very good sort of people; friendly and hospitable, not much educated, and not at all elegant., She could not imagine a man, \"I think very differently,\" answered Elizabeth, shortly; \"an agreeable manner may set off handsome features, but can never alter plain ones., And a very good living, But I have not known him long; and he is not a man, I think, to be known intimately soon., I am sure you will not like him.\", But I should like to know why, at that time of his life, he should slight my father's acquaintance as he did., But nobody heard, or, at least, nobody answered her., Charles Musgrove, indeed, afterwards, shewed more of inclination; \"the child was going on so well, and he wished so much to be introduced to Captain Wentworth, that, perhaps, he might join them in the evening, They could think of no one else., He is just Lady Russell's sort., Anne's good-will, however, was not to be lessened by what she heard., Your interest, Sir Walter, is in pretty safe hands., He had given her some hints of it the last spring in town; he had gone so far even as to say, \"Can we retrench?, Mr Shepherd hastened to assure him, that Admiral Croft was a very hale, hearty, well-looking man, a little weather-beaten, to be sure, but not much, and quite the gentleman in all his notions and behaviour; not likely to make the smallest difficulty about terms, only wanted a comfortable home, and to get into it as soon as possible; knew he must pay for his convenience; knew what rent a ready-furnished house of that consequence might fetch; should not have been surprised if Sir Walter had asked more; had inquired about the manor; would be glad of the deputation, certainly, but made no great point of it; said he sometimes took out a gun, but never killed; quite the gentleman., So, you are come at last!, To-night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party,\" (turning to Anne.), It was soon generally agreed that Tuesday should be the day; Charles only reserving the advantage of still teasing his wife, by persisting that he would go to the play to-morrow if nobody else would., \"All merged in my friendship, Sophia., Alas!, They were more in love with him; yet there it was not love., One day only had passed since Anne's conversation with Mrs Smith; but a keener interest had succeeded, and she was now so little touched by Mr Elliot's conduct, except by its effects in one quarter,, Certainly not a great match for Louisa Musgrove, but a million times better than marrying among the Hayters., His choice of subjects, his expressions, and still more his manner and look, had been such as she could see in only one light., He had many years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot as had inspired him with the highest idea of her merit, and excited the warmest curiosity to know her., I assure you that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week., I will not allow books to prove anything.\", The first act was over., Here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of Charles's following the others to admire mirrors and china; but Anne had heard enough to understand the present state of Uppercross, and rejoice in its happiness; and though she sighed as she rejoiced, her sigh had none of the ill-will of envy in it., I was at Plymouth dreading to hear of him; he sent in letters, but the Grappler was under orders for Portsmouth., \"She could not make a very long history, I think, of one such little article of unfounded news., but what shall we say now, Captain Harville?, It was what she had been thinking of, and wishing to be allowed to do., \"I might not like them the better for that perhaps., She is rather done for this morning, and must not go so far without help, and I ought to be at that fellow's in the Market Place., and she sits so upright!, Her feelings made her speak low; and Captain Wentworth, hearing only in part, and probably not having Dick Musgrove at all near his thoughts, looked rather in suspense, and as if waiting for more., His lameness prevented him from taking much exercise; but a mind of usefulness and ingenuity seemed to furnish him with constant employment within., They had arrived late the night before., Captain Benwick listened attentively, and seemed grateful for the interest implied; and though with a shake of the head, and sighs which declared his little faith in the efficacy of any books on grief like his, noted down the names of those she recommended, and promised to procure and read them., The evening came, the drawing-rooms were lighted up, the company assembled., This very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still, after an interval of several years, felt with anger by Elizabeth, who had liked the man for himself, and still more for being her father's heir, and whose strong family pride could see only in him a proper match for Sir Walter Elliot's eldest daughter., Charles, ring and order a chair., No one had ever come within the Kellynch circle, who could bear a comparison with Frederick Wentworth, as he stood in her memory., The two ladies continued to talk, to re-urge the same admitted truths, and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation, but Anne heard nothing distinctly; it was only a buzz of words in her ear, her mind was in confusion., The walking party had crossed the lane, and were surmounting an opposite stile, and the Admiral was putting his horse in motion again, when Captain Wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something to his sister., \", Thank you, thank you., Her mother could even think of her being able to join their party at home, before her brothers and sisters went to school again., In fact, Anne could never see the crape round his hat, without fearing that she was the inexcusable one, in attributing to him such imaginations; for though his marriage had not been very happy, still it had existed so many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery from the awful impression of its being dissolved., After listening to this full description of Mr Elliot, Anne could not but express some surprise at Mrs Smith's having spoken of him so favourably in the beginning of their conversation., Anne found a nice seat for her, on a dry sunny bank, under the hedge-row, in which she had no doubt of their still being, in some spot or other., Here Anne had often been staying., Captain Wentworth, who had caught her up, knelt with her in his arms, looking on her with a face as pallid as her own, in an agony of silence., in that degree of consideration which we must all wish for.\", Indeed, I must do ourselves the justice to say, that the few alterations we have made have been all very much for the better., \"Quit Kellynch Hall., The character of his manner was embarrassment., After talking, however, of the weather, and Bath, and the concert, their conversation began to flag, and so little was said at last, that she was expecting him to go every moment, but, She was a benevolent, charitable, good woman, and capable of strong attachments, most correct in her conduct, strict in her notions of decorum, and with manners that were held a standard of good-breeding., He was only wrong in accepting the attentions (for accepting must be the word) of two young women at once., She would take place of me then, and Henrietta would not dislike that., He delighted in being asked, but he would not tell. \", There had been three alternatives, London, Bath, or another house in the country., So ended all danger to Anne of meeting Captain Wentworth at Kellynch Hall, or of seeing him in company with her friend., It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than she was ten years before; and, generally speaking, if there has been neither ill health nor anxiety, But,\" continued Anne, presently, \"though there is no truth in my having this claim on Mr Elliot, I should be extremely happy to be of use to you in any way that I could., She had the kindest \"Good morning, God bless you!\", All that sounded extravagant or irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin but in the language of the relators., He is only a commander, it is true, made last summer, and these are bad times for getting on, but he has not another fault that I know of., She had seen the same Frederick Wentworth. \", She would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting., This is a recollection which ought to make me forgive every one sooner than myself., \"Well done, Miss Anne!, That was his motive for drawing back, I can assure you., She was assisted, however, by that perfect indifference and apparent unconsciousness, among the only three of her own friends in the secret of the past, which seemed almost to deny any recollection of it., Something occurred, however, to give her a different duty., You must, indeed, you must., Captain Wentworth's eyes were also turned towards her. \", Her spirits were not high., Anybody between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking., \"Oh!, There had been a time, Mrs Smith told her, when her spirits had nearly failed., \"Your first was the Asp, I remember; we will look for the Asp.\", Women of that class have great opportunities, and if they are intelligent may be well worth listening to., Charles and Henrietta returned, bringing, as may be conjectured, Charles Hayter with them., True, upon my honour!, Does she never mean to go away?, \", I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he was a dozen years ago, and I will shew him as he is now., Take a box for to-morrow night!, Lady Russell and Mrs Croft were very well pleased with each other: but the acquaintance which this visit began was fated not to proceed far at present; for when it was returned, the Crofts announced themselves to be going away for a few weeks, to visit their connexions in the north of the county, and probably might not be at home again before Lady Russell would be removing to Bath., It was now his object to marry., It was but a passing emotion however with Mrs Smith; she shook it off, and soon added in a different tone--, I have been acquainted with you by character many years., A speedy cure must not be hoped, but everything was going on as well as the nature of the case admitted., Her knowledge of her father and Elizabeth inclined her to think that the sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of both, and so on, through the whole list of Lady Russell's too gentle reductions., Of course they must attend., Your person, your disposition, accomplishments, manner; they were all present to me.\", Yes, I am sure, Oh!, He had never indulged much hope, he had now none, of ever reading her name in any other page of his favourite work., \"But I ought to have looked about me more,\" said Anne, conscious while she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about, that the object only had been deficient., The only one among them, whose opposition of feeling could excite any serious anxiety was Lady Russell., How mortifying to feel that it was so!, nobody would think it worth their while to observe me; but Sir Walter Elliot has eyes upon him which it may be very difficult to elude; and therefore, thus much I venture upon, that it will not greatly surprise me if, with all our caution, some rumour of the truth should get abroad; in the supposition of which, as I was going to observe, since applications will unquestionably follow, I should think any from our wealthy naval commanders particularly worth attending to; and beg leave to add, that two hours will bring me over at any time, to save you the trouble of replying.\", If I could explain to you all this, and all that a man can bear and do, and glories to do, for the sake of these treasures of his existence!, \"I must endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune., She had but two friends in the world to add to his list, Lady Russell and Mrs Smith., , she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off together in high spirits., could the originals of the portraits against the wainscot, \"Any acquaintance of Anne's will always be welcome to me,\" was Lady Russell's kind answer., If I am a fool, I shall be a fool indeed, for I have thought on the subject more than most men.\", The box was brought and placed before her, and Mrs Smith, sighing over it as she unlocked it, said--, , it would have been another thing., Anne had a great deal to hear of Mr Elliot., ; she consented, she was anxious to be at home., continued--, Forty?\", \"I have no conception whom you can mean, Shepherd; I remember no gentleman resident at Monkford since the time of old Governor Trent.\", His value for rank and connexion she perceived was greater than hers., Never was a better sloop than the Asp in her day., It is a pity you cannot put your sister in the way of managing them., She spoke, and seemed only to offend., She did all that I wanted., Anne will stay; Anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him., (pointing to Captain Wentworth.), The intimacy had been formed before our marriage., Such a number of women and children have no right to be comfortable on board.\", Anne, satisfied at a very early period of Lady Russell's meaning to love Captain Wentworth as she ought, had no other alloy to the happiness of her prospects than what arose from the consciousness of having no relations to bestow on him which a man of sense could value., Such was her situation, with a vacant space at hand, when Captain Wentworth was again in sight., Mrs Musgrove had got Mrs Harville's children away as much as she could, every possible supply from Uppercross had been furnished, to lighten the inconvenience to the Harvilles, while the Harvilles had been wanting them to come to dinner every day; and in short, it seemed to have been only a struggle on each side as to which should be most disinterested and hospitable., Here is complete proof.\", He declares himself, that coming to Lyme for a month, did him more good than all the medicine he took; and, that being by the sea, always makes him feel young again., As soon as she could, she went after Mary, and having found, and walked back with her to their former station, by the stile, felt some comfort in their whole party being immediately afterwards collected, and once more in motion together., \"To see you,\" cried he, \"in the midst of those who could not be my well-wishers; to see your cousin close by you, conversing and smiling, and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match!, Doubtless it was so, and she could take no revenge, for he was not altered, or not for the worse., A degree of unexpected cordiality, however, in the welcome she received, did her good., I do not think they were.\", She was not sorry for the excuse., Her start was perceptible only to herself; but she instantly felt that she was the greatest simpleton in the world, the most unaccountable and absurd!, \"Oh yes!, But as to the rest, as to the others, if one stays to assist Mrs Harville, I think it need be only one., No, I have no idea of being so easily persuaded., She saw Mrs Clay fairly off, therefore, before she began to talk of spending the morning in Rivers Street., On one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have prevented, she was soon spared all suspense; for, after the Miss Musgroves had returned and finished their visit at the Cottage, \", I am not sorry, indeed, to make it over to another., her very regular, very pretty features, having the bloom and freshness of youth restored by the fine wind which had been blowing on her complexion, and by the animation of eye which it had also produced., They were wretched together., A blush overspread Anne's cheeks., As soon as they were out of sight, the ladies of Captain Wentworth's party began talking of them. \", Ah!, The Musgroves, like their houses, were in a state of alteration, perhaps of improvement., Do not forget me when you are married, that's all., She saw how her own character was considered by Captain Wentworth, and there had been just that degree of feeling and curiosity about her in his manner which must give her extreme agitation., She had called on her former governess, and had heard from her of there being an old school-fellow in Bath, who had the two strong claims on her attention of past kindness and present suffering., It had been the effect of over-persuasion., Before Mrs Croft had written, he was arrived, and the very next time Anne walked out, she saw him., What do you take his age to be?', One five minutes brought a note, the next a parcel; and Anne had not been there half an hour, when their dining-room, spacious as it was, seemed more than half filled: a party of steady old friends were seated around Mrs Musgrove, and Charles came back with Captains Harville and Wentworth., I had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many ways; and that I had no right to be trying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls, at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report, were there no other ill effects., I have had all my own little concerns to arrange, books and music to divide, and all my trunks to repack, from not having understood in time what was intended as to the waggons: and one thing I have had to do, Mary, of a more trying nature: going to almost every house in the parish, as a sort of take-leave., She could not understand his present feelings, whether he were really suffering much from disappointment or not; and till that point were settled, she could not be quite herself., Anne sighed and blushed and smiled, in pity and disdain, either at her friend or herself., , I dare say., He could meet even Lady Russell in a discussion of her merits; and Anne could not be given to understand so much by her friend, could not know herself to be so highly rated by a sensible man, without many of those agreeable sensations which her friend meant to create., From his wife's account of him she could discern Mr Smith to have been a man of warm feelings, easy temper, careless habits, and not strong understanding, much more amiable than his friend, and very unlike him, led by him, and probably despised by him., If Louisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her November of life, she will cherish all her present powers of mind.\", At this moment I cannot recollect his name, though I have heard it so lately., She really left nothing for Mary to do., She had hoped better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life, and was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen; a wish that they had more pride; for \"our cousins Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret;\" \"our cousins, the Dalrymples,\" sounded in her ears all day long., It was now some years since Anne had begun to learn that she and her excellent friend could sometimes think differently; and it did not surprise her, therefore, that Lady Russell should see nothing suspicious or inconsistent, nothing to require more motives than appeared, in Mr Elliot's great desire of a reconciliation.]\n"

      "Anne, Anne,\" cried Charles, \"What is to be done next?\n",
      "\"I am sorry to say that I am very far from well; and Jemima has just told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore-throat very much about.\n",
      "It was the choicest gift of Heaven; and Anne viewed her friend as one of those instances in which, by a merciful appointment, it seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want.\n",
      "The sounds were retreating, and Anne distinguished no more.\n",
      "He was not only to quit his home, but to see it in the hands of others; a trial of fortitude, which stronger heads than Sir Walter's have found too much.\n",
      "Lady Russell quite bores one with her new publications.\n",
      "Mrs Clay had freckles, and a projecting tooth, and a clumsy wrist, which he was continually making severe remarks upon, in her absence; but she was young, and certainly altogether well-looking, and possessed, in an acute mind and assiduous pleasing manners, infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal might have been.\n",
      "That's what he did, and nobody else could have saved poor James.\n",
      "She could not distinguish, but she must guess the subject; and on Captain Wentworth's making a distant bow, she comprehended that her father had judged so well as to give him that simple acknowledgement of acquaintance, and she was just in time by a side glance to see a slight curtsey from Elizabeth herself.\n",
      "On the contrary, when he saw more of Captain Wentworth, saw him repeatedly by daylight, and eyed him well, he was very much struck by his personal claims, and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her superiority of rank; and all this, assisted by his well-sounding name, enabled Sir Walter at last to prepare his pen, with a very good grace, for the insertion of the marriage in the volume of honour.\n",
      "Captain Wentworth believed it impossible for man to be more attached to woman than\n",
      "And before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation, Charles, Mary, and Henrietta all came in.\n",
      "It was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and inhumanity; and Anne felt, at some moments, that no flagrant open crime could have been worse.\n",
      "What Miss Anne says, is very true,\" was Mr Shepherd's rejoinder, and\n",
      "This was against her; but on the other hand, he spent so much of his time at Uppercross, that in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him behind, than as going towards him; and, upon the whole, she believed she must, on this interesting question, be the gainer, almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society, in leaving poor Mary for Lady Russell.\n",
      "The tone, the look, with which \"Thank God!\" was uttered by Captain Wentworth, Anne was sure could never be forgotten by her; nor the sight of him afterwards, as he sat near a table, leaning over it with folded arms and face concealed, as if overpowered by the various feelings of his soul, and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them.\n",
      "A chaise was sent for from Crewkherne, and Charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery-maid of the family, one who having brought up all the children, and seen the very last, the lingering and long-petted Master Harry, sent to school after his brothers, was now living in her deserted nursery to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises\n",
      "poor Benwick had been to Fanny Harville, or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful change.\n",
      "She felt its application to herself, felt it in a nervous thrill all over her; and at the same moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table, Captain Wentworth's pen ceased to move, his head was raised, pausing, listening, and he turned round the next instant to give a look, one quick, conscious look at her.\n",
      "He described one Miss Elliot, and I thought very affectionately of the other.\"\n",
      "Shocked as Captain Harville was, he brought senses and nerves that could be instantly useful; and a look between him and his wife decided what was to be done.\n",
      "With the Musgroves, there was the happy chat of perfect ease; with Captain Harville, the kind-hearted intercourse of brother and sister; with Lady Russell, attempts at conversation, which a delicious consciousness cut short; with Admiral and Mrs Croft, everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest, which the same consciousness sought to conceal; and with Captain Wentworth, some moments of communications continually occurring, and always the hope of more, and always the knowledge of his being there.\n",

      "\"I am sorry to say that I am very far from well; and Jemima has just told me that the butcher says there is a bad sore-throat very much about.\n",
      "It was the choicest gift of Heaven; and Anne viewed her friend as one of those instances in which, by a merciful appointment, it seems designed to counterbalance almost every other want.\n",
      "The sounds were retreating, and Anne distinguished no more.\n",
      "He was not only to quit his home, but to see it in the hands of others; a trial of fortitude, which stronger heads than Sir Walter's have found too much.\n",
      "Lady Russell quite bores one with her new publications.\n",
      "Mrs Clay had freckles, and a projecting tooth, and a clumsy wrist, which he was continually making severe remarks upon, in her absence; but she was young, and certainly altogether well-looking, and possessed, in an acute mind and assiduous pleasing manners, infinitely more dangerous attractions than any merely personal might have been.\n",
      "That's what he did, and nobody else could have saved poor James.\n",
      "She could not distinguish, but she must guess the subject; and on Captain Wentworth's making a distant bow, she comprehended that her father had judged so well as to give him that simple acknowledgement of acquaintance, and she was just in time by a side glance to see a slight curtsey from Elizabeth herself.\n",
      "On the contrary, when he saw more of Captain Wentworth, saw him repeatedly by daylight, and eyed him well, he was very much struck by his personal claims, and felt that his superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her superiority of rank; and all this, assisted by his well-sounding name, enabled Sir Walter at last to prepare his pen, with a very good grace, for the insertion of the marriage in the volume of honour.\n",
      "Captain Wentworth believed it impossible for man to be more attached to woman than\n",
      "And before she was beyond the first stage of full sensation, Charles, Mary, and Henrietta all came in.\n",
      "It was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and inhumanity; and Anne felt, at some moments, that no flagrant open crime could have been worse.\n",
      "What Miss Anne says, is very true,\" was Mr Shepherd's rejoinder, and\n",
      "This was against her; but on the other hand, he spent so much of his time at Uppercross, that in removing thence she might be considered rather as leaving him behind, than as going towards him; and, upon the whole, she believed she must, on this interesting question, be the gainer, almost as certainly as in her change of domestic society, in leaving poor Mary for Lady Russell.\n",
      "The tone, the look, with which \"Thank God!\" was uttered by Captain Wentworth, Anne was sure could never be forgotten by her; nor the sight of him afterwards, as he sat near a table, leaning over it with folded arms and face concealed, as if overpowered by the various feelings of his soul, and trying by prayer and reflection to calm them.\n",
      "A chaise was sent for from Crewkherne, and Charles conveyed back a far more useful person in the old nursery-maid of the family, one who having brought up all the children, and seen the very last, the lingering and long-petted Master Harry, sent to school after his brothers, was now living in her deserted nursery to mend stockings and dress all the blains and bruises\n",
      "poor Benwick had been to Fanny Harville, or to be more deeply afflicted under the dreadful change.\n",
      "She felt its application to herself, felt it in a nervous thrill all over her; and at the same moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table, Captain Wentworth's pen ceased to move, his head was raised, pausing, listening, and he turned round the next instant to give a look, one quick, conscious look at her.\n",
      "He described one Miss Elliot, and I thought very affectionately of the other.\"\n",
      "Shocked as Captain Harville was, he brought senses and nerves that could be instantly useful; and a look between him and his wife decided what was to be done.\n",
      "With the Musgroves, there was the happy chat of perfect ease; with Captain Harville, the kind-hearted intercourse of brother and sister; with Lady Russell, attempts at conversation, which a delicious consciousness cut short; with Admiral and Mrs Croft, everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest, which the same consciousness sought to conceal; and with Captain Wentworth, some moments of communications continually occurring, and always the hope of more, and always the knowledge of his being there.\n",
      "Accordingly their removal was made together, and Anne was set down at Uppercross Cottage, in the first stage of Lady Russell's journey.\n",
      "Very, very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked in.\n",
